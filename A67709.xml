            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:58267:3"/>Birth, made me preſume to offer It to your Lordſhips Patronage; which however I ſcarcely ſhould have ventured to do, being ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known to your Lordſhip, as I am, if your <hi>Condeſcention,</hi> and <hi>Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> did not make as great a part of your <hi>Character,</hi> as any other of thoſe <hi>Heroick Qualities,</hi> of which it is <hi>compoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there is ſo <hi>near</hi> a <hi>Parallel</hi> betwixt your Lordſhip, and my Author, that I need not go farther for an <hi>Apology:</hi> For both of you, with all the advantages of <hi>Nature, Birth,</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> entred <hi>early</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58267:3"/>upon high Truſts, &amp; happily <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> them.

            </p>
            <p>Both of you great Promoters of <hi>Learning,</hi> and Favourers of <hi>learned</hi> men, and (which rarely happens) joyn'd with it an exquiſite skill in <hi>Martial</hi> Affairs.</p>
            <p>Both of you concerned <hi>in</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:58267:4"/>ſucceſsfully perform'd that part which is <hi>juſtly</hi> reckoned the moſt <hi>difficult Point</hi> of War; for as <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> conducted the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army through the large <hi>Tracts</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and made good their <hi>Retreat,</hi> ſo did your Lordſhip bring off the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> from <hi>Africk,</hi> and as a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>delivered them,</hi> when they lay expoſed as a cheap prey to the worſt ſort of Barbarians.</p>
            <p>An Action which conſidered in all its Circumſtances, the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the <hi>Work,</hi> the <hi>violence</hi> of the <hi>Seaſon,</hi> a <hi>vigilant, powerful,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable</hi> Enemy, watching all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb facs="tcp:58267:5"/>to fall upon you, was not only of greater <hi>Conſequence</hi> to the Nation; but an inſtance too of <hi>Conduct,</hi> not inferior to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is a <hi>common</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that <hi>thoſe very</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſince endeavour to <hi>leſſen</hi> that performance, when your Lordſhip with your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Obedience undertook the <hi>Expedition,</hi> gave it out for <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to mention that <hi>by the way,</hi> as it were, You almoſt ruined
<pb facs="tcp:58267:5"/>
               <hi>Sally,</hi> that troubleſome Neſt of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, the greateſt Infeſters of the <hi>Engliſh Navigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor to ſay any thing of the great Number of poor Engliſh Slaves which you moſt charitably redeemed, who every day they riſe, are obliged to bleſs your Lordſhip for the Sight of their <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> and all the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> of their <hi>Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Hiſtory relates the <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal</hi> of three <hi>Famous Common-wealths,</hi> and (one would think) were a ſufficient Argument to convince
<pb facs="tcp:58267:6"/>
               <hi>even our Republicans,</hi> that that ſame <hi>accurſed Fruit,</hi> which could thrive no better in its <hi>own Native Soyl,</hi> would much leſs proſper <hi>tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hither,</hi> and <hi>engrafted</hi> on one of the moſt <hi>Ancient</hi> Monarchies in the World.</p>
            <p>And as your Lordſhips <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> contributed very much to the <hi>reducing</hi> a <hi>Neighbouring</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to its juſt Bounds, (for the <hi>Dutch</hi> will never <hi>forget</hi> your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> tho <hi>Engliſh</hi> men ſhould) ſo was there no one more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in <hi>cruſhing</hi> a <hi>riſing Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> here at home: Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:58267:6"/>ſtill <hi>broke,</hi> and <hi>prevented</hi> their <hi>Deſigns,</hi> put them clear out of the Road of 41, <hi>puzzled</hi> all their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> by ſecuring the <hi>Magazines</hi> and <hi>Stores,</hi> which if you had not come in their way, they with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability looked upon as their <hi>Own:</hi> So that thoſe who at firſt could not comprehend the Reaſon of your Proceedings, upon the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the late <hi>Horrid Conſpiracy,</hi> cannot ſufficiently admire, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud your Lordſhips <hi>Vigilance,</hi> and <hi>Conduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed as no <hi>Subject</hi> would have been worſe treated if their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb facs="tcp:58267:7"/>Deſigns had took <hi>effect,</hi> ſo are all ſorts of People ſenſible of it to that <hi>degree,</hi> that ſcarcely any one is now reckoned <hi>truly affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to the Service of your <hi>Two Royal Maſters,</hi> who has not a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Eſteem, and Honour for your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>It is well for the Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that you have not leaſure to make out the <hi>Parallel,</hi> by writing an <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> although your <hi>own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits</hi> would afford ſufficient Matter for one. Your Lordſhips hours are employed about more <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and no leſs <hi>lasting Works</hi> than
<pb facs="tcp:58267:7"/>my Authors. Not only the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, but <hi>late Poſterity</hi> too, will be indebted to your Lordſhips <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable,</hi> and <hi>extenſive</hi> Care, for their <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> both at <hi>home,</hi> and <hi>abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one <hi>happy diſparity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>You,</hi> and my Author, that, as he lived in the <hi>Dregs</hi> of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> ſo does your Lordſhip ſerve the <hi>Wiſeſt,</hi> and <hi>Braveſt</hi> Princes in the World; who are no leſs Renowned for their Firmneſs to their Friends, and Royal Bounty in <hi>Rewarding</hi> them; Then <hi>Athens</hi> will be <hi>Infamous</hi> to all Ages for
<pb facs="tcp:58267:8"/>her <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to thoſe who did her the greateſt Service.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TRanſlation having been ſo much in Vogue of late, and ſeveral Authors turn'd into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> I made ſome Attempt herein, though with ſmall hopes of Succeſs: But at laſt having mentioned my Deſign to that Learned Gentleman, and my honoured Friend, Sir <hi>Edward Sherborne,</hi> he was pleaſed to encourage my <hi>Endeavours,</hi> both with the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Sentiments, and the free uſe of his Curious and Choice Collection of Books; for which I thought my ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to return him this Publick Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; as alſo for the great Civilities, and continued Favours received from his hands.</p>
            <p>But amongſt other Inducements I had to Tranſlate this Piece of <hi>Xenophon:</hi> One was, to ſhew by the <hi>Examples</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Commonwealths</hi> mentioned in this <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> that there is not that liberty to be expected from theſe Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which our <hi>Republicans</hi> propos'd to themſelves and Followers. For though the continual Cry of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and against Oppreſſion, yet they
<pb facs="tcp:58267:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>procured no further Remedy by their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, than thoſe who ſhift their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from Shoulder to Shoulder, but leſſen not the Weight; and at most they did but change the Tyranny, but not enlarge their Liberty. The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Constitution, had its Defects, and thoſe not ſmall ones; and though it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed longer than any of the reſt in <hi>Greece,</hi> yet it had doubleſs been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled in Seditions and civil Wars, like other States, had there not been one thing peculiar to that Government: which was the exact Diſcipline and Obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Youth and Men were trained up; being eſteemed Sons of the Publick, and not of private Perſons: which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> partly imitated, by giving the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power over his Son all his life-time, or till he was thrice ſold, and manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and to this did <hi>Dionyſius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſenſis</hi> aſcribe the Greatneſs of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</hi>

            <p>But for the proof of my Aſſertion, I ſhall give a brief account of the <hi>Athenian, Lacedemonian,</hi> and <hi>Roman Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,</hi> the laſt being framed after the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Model; and ſhew from theſe Inſtances, that the Changes of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and noiſe for <hi>Liberty,</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:58267:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Occaſion of all their Miſeries.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>Lacedemonian;</hi> an indifferent <hi>Obſervator</hi> may at first ſight diſcover, from whence our <hi>Republicans</hi> have taken their Meaſures: and that the ſame Approaches have been made on our Monarchy as were on the <hi>Lacedemonian;</hi> and without doubt they had carried on their Deſigns as far, had they not been timely diſcovered, and happily prevented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings were at firſt abſolute, and continued ſo till two Kings ſat on the Throne at once, their Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more diminiſhed hereby, than when there were Conſorts in the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> or now that there are two <hi>Czars</hi> in <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> At length ſome of the Kings ſtraining their Power (there being no Government but what may be abuſed, whilſt Men are ſubject to Paſſions, and Things to Change.) <hi>Lycurgus</hi> one of the Royal blood contrived a new Model, joyning the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with the Kings in the Government; and made ſeveral Laws in favour of the People, taking with him the Nobility to the <hi>Oracle</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> to enquire what <hi>Apollo</hi> thought of them: who confirmed his Laws, and ſo the obſervance of them became a Point of Conſcience. Thus the Nobility firſt Invaded the Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:
<pb facs="tcp:58267:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>about <hi>130</hi> years after, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompus</hi> an eaſie King, thinking to entail the Kingdom more firmly on his Poſterity, Inſtituted the <hi>Ephori;</hi> who being farther to temper, and allay the Power of the King, did ſo far encroach in time, that he became their Slave; and they made him little more than a private man; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power to Mulct, Impriſon, Baniſh, and put him to death; nay, to alter the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, when they thought good. They had alſo the Priviledge to ſit, when the King came into their preſence, thinking it not proper to pay him Reſpect, whom they had under their Correction. The <hi>Ephori</hi> could make War and Peace; the <hi>Ephori</hi> could put any to Death, without form of Juſtice: they were Treaſurers, they kept the King poor, and their Power became at laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant and tyrannical.</p>
            <p>In the next place I come to ſpeak of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth; the <hi>Athenians</hi> lived under a Monarchy, till that good King <hi>Codrus,</hi> who ſacrificed himſelf for his Country; and thereby gained ſo great a Veneration from the people, that they thought none worthy to ſucceed him, but changed the Kingly Government into a Republick adminiſtred by perpetual Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chons, who were afterwards created for Ten
<pb facs="tcp:58267:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>years, and at last for One.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xenophon</hi> the Author of this Hiſtory was an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and being a Perſon of ſo great Learning and Ingenuity, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably related nothing to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Country: yet in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Athenian Commonwealth,</hi> he finds ſeveral faults with it. Firſt, That the People had too great a Power, and carried all by Violence and Tumult; and that it fared better in that Government with Rogues, than Honest-men: Beſides the ſeveral Changes it ſuffered during the Tranſactions of this History, ſufficiently evince its weakneſs, and imprudent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Their Reformer <hi>Solon</hi> ſettled his Laws by making himſelf Popular, and by introducing a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a kind of Jubile, being like the <hi>Novae tabulae</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was a forgiving all Debtors what they owed? Though he valued not the great Injuſtice and Oppreſſion offer'd to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, by depriving them of their Eſtates at the ſame time, that he gave this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to the poorer ſort. Their <hi>Oſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme</hi> was a ſevere and unjuſt Law, by which they baniſhed the bravest men, that had by their gallant Actions won the Love and Veneration of the People: And though this Popularity was not by their
<pb facs="tcp:58267:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeeking, but a neceſſary Conſequence of their Noble Exploits; yet they muſt be packed out of the way for Ten years, and ruined: So great a Crime it was to deſerve well of their Country! This opened a Door to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and other pretences; for when any Faction had a mind to rid themſelves of a Great Man, they had nothing to do but poſſeſs the people with a jealouſie of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, for which he was baniſhed, and their buſineſs done. Indeed ſome were Generous, and over-looked their Pieviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but on the contrary, others, as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> reſented it, who may truly be ſaid to be the firſt that contrived the ruine of his Country.</p>
            <p>In theſe Commonwealths for want of a Supream Head, the Ambitious thought they had as good a Title to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as others; and by this means they were divided into Factions; the ſtronger always taking it for granted that they were in the right, and thereupon baniſhed the weaker; who fled for protection to the Neighbouring Republicks, where they being ſet on by revenge, plotted and contrived to embroyl their Country in a War. The kind Reception the Fugitives found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Athenians</hi> (who were in this the <hi>Dutch</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi>) made them not
<pb facs="tcp:58267:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſcruple to commit any Crimes, ſeeing they could find ſuch eaſie ſhelter from Justice and the Law.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> after the expulſion of their Kings, framed their Commonwealth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Model, creating two <hi>Conſuls;</hi> and for the ſame reaſons that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did two Kings. But the People conſidering that they had no power, and the Senate all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſeditious: Nor would they be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till they in imitation of the <hi>Spartan Ephori</hi> had created <hi>Tribunes;</hi> whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſo Sacred, that if any did but ſpeak derogatory from them, they had power to put him to Death without a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Nor were any the Authors of Sedition, Tumults, Murthers, and Civil Diſcord, more than the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the People. 'Twas theſe that ruined the Commonwealth, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to defend. The Authority of the Emperors that were abſolute Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> was made up of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Conſul's</hi> Power: One may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence, that there is not that liberty to be found in theſe <hi>Republicks,</hi> which ſome have imagined, and that the Subjects in them were meer Slaves, the <hi>Ephori</hi> being <hi>Tyrants</hi> amongſt the
<pb facs="tcp:58267:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the People amongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> For what greater Power can there be, than to inflict Puniſhment of Death without Form of Juſtice? Eſtate follows Life; and what can't they do in Religion, who are abſolute Maſters of the other two? Liberty is deſired by all; of which we by our wiſe Conſtitution have a greater ſhare than any Nation either has, or we could expect from a Change. And becauſe our own Examples affect us moſt, we may look back to the late Civil Wars, which were begun and fomented for the Cauſe of Religion and Liberty; yet both deſtroyed: the unhappy Nation ſuffering well nigh as many Alterations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it did Years of War and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The Troubles alſo drew along with them, <hi>Rebellion, Schiſm, Faction, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> and a Train of Vices; whoſe dire effects we ſtill ſee in the General Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Manners and Tendency of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious</hi> to the <hi>Old Game.</hi> Nor could our Differences be compoſed, till the Rightful Heir was recalled, and the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment together with our Liberty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: which we enjoy under our Gracious Prince, rather unthankfully repining, than juſtly prizing it.</p>

            <head>A brief Account of the Land and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Forces of the Ancient <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Thought it might be neceſſary for the better underſtanding of this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> to give ſome Account of the Land and Naval Forces of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> yet not to make a ſet Diſcourſe about it, but only to ſpeak of the <hi>Militia,</hi> as it was in the time of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War: this Art continually altering and improving as well in former Times, as in this preſent Age.</p>
            <p>It will be neceſſary alſo to Treat ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Diſcipline, becauſe it was diſtinct from that of the reſt of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and then ſpeak of thoſe Particulars, wherein the <hi>Athenians</hi> and others varied from it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant People of all the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and tho' their Numbers were but ſmall, yet they were ſo well experienced, that they very rarely miſt of Succeſs, fighting with an aſſurance of Victory. Their Life was continually employ'd in Action, and ſuch Proviſion was made by the Laws of
<pb facs="tcp:58267:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>their Country, that not only the Men, but the Women alſo were uſed to Robuſt Exerciſes, and the Parents inured to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that the Children might be rendred ſtrong, and able to undergo the Fatigue of War.</p>
            <p>The Youth were divided into two Parties, and exercifed Mock-battels, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring whereſoever they met, yet were they under ſuch exact Diſcipline, that if any came by, and offered to part them, and they refuſed to obey, they were immediately carried before the <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donomus,</hi> a Magiſtrate that took cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of thoſe Crimes, and ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd them, for being ſo far tranſported with Paſſion, as not to pay due Obedience to the Laws.</p>
            <p>By this their Diſcipline they became hardy and reſolute, fighting with that obſtinacy, that they would rather die, than yield: But farther to habituate them to this Virtue of Martial Patience, they were once a year cruelly whipt at the Altar of <hi>Diana Orthia,</hi> which though it were rather a Puniſhment than an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, yet they bore it with an Invincible Courage.</p>
            <p>In this manner they were Train'd up till they came to thirty years of age; for
<pb facs="tcp:58267:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>before none were ſuffered to go into the <hi>Campagn,</hi> unleſs it were upon a very great neceſſity. Thus having ſpent ſo many years in the Speculation of War, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo ſtrong and vigorous in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof, that they laſted forty years fit for Service, none having a Miſſion till he was ſeventy years of age.</p>
            <p>Their Infantry conſiſted of Targetiers, Light-arm'd, and Heavy-arm'd men; the Light-arm'd men were placed in the Wings, being commanded out in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone-hope, and uſed in Skirmiſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not loaden with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Their Arms were Arrows, Darts, Staves, and Stones, which they threw, or ſlung; taking any extemporary Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that came in their way. The <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt</hi> of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> ſays, they did not cloſe, but fought at ſome diſtance, advancing, and retiring as they ſaw occaſion for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Targetiers were a middle ſort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Light and Heavy-arm'd men, having a Target or leſſer Shield, and a Sword: They were nimble and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and very uſeful for purſuing; the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Regiment near <hi>Corinth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off by <hi>Iphicrates</hi>'s Targetiers.</p>
            <p>The Heavy-arm'd men were raiſed out
<pb facs="tcp:58267:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the beter ſort, the other two being for the moſt part Mercenaries and Half-ſlaves: Their Arms were a Shield of Braſs, a Pike and a Scymitar; their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was to repulſe the Enemy, and to maintain their ground, becauſe the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Day depended on them; for if they were Defeated the Army was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Routed: And in theſe indeed did the chief Strength of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> conſiſt. When they put the Enemy to flight, the Horſe light-arm'd men, and Targetiers purſued, though it was a Maxime amongſt them, <hi>Not to be too eager, but to make their Enemies a Bridge of Gold, leſt Deſperation ſhould make them fight and vanquiſh their Purſuers.</hi> Our Author alſo blames <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> for meeting the Enemy in their flight, whereas he ought to have rather given them way, and followed the Purſuit.</p>
            <p>As for their Horſe, the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had a Body of three hundred that fought near the King, like the <hi>Roman Celeres:</hi> But they were very deficient in this part of their <hi>Militia,</hi> thoſe they had were arm'd with Spears, and Charged full Cariere; ſome of them carried Bows, and were called <hi>Hippotoxotae.</hi> They were furniſhed with the main Body of their
<pb facs="tcp:58267:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>Horſe from the <hi>Thebans;</hi> and being at War with them, they were deprived of thoſe <hi>Auxiliaries:</hi> So that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> General, knowing the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> were weak in <hi>Cavalry,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them at the Battels of <hi>Leuctra</hi> and <hi>Mantinea,</hi> with his own and the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Troops, whereby he gave them thoſe two memorable Overthrows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Forces conſiſted both of their own Subjects, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and their Allies. Of the firſt there were four ſorts: The <hi>Spartans</hi> which were the Inhabitants of the City, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed more Priviledges than the reſt; the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> which dwelt in the Country; the Half-ſlaves who had merited Freedom by their Valour: The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> thinking it of dangerous Conſequence to cut them abſolutely off of all hopes, leſt the deſperateneſs of their Fortune might provoke them to riſe up in Arms againſt the Government, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it: the laſt were the Slaves, the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates</hi> for Liberty, whom they trained, becauſe the Wars made ſuch a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of People, and raiſed Emulation in them, that they might advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby to their Freedom. The Confederates made up the Groſs of their
<pb facs="tcp:58267:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>Army, for their own Numbers were but ſmall, which they concealed either out of a Maxime of their own, or that the Enemies by knowing how few they were, might not deſpiſe them: Yet this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Number, were men of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Valour, that <hi>Agis</hi> being askt, How many ſtrong the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were? made anſwer, <hi>Enough to fight any Army whatſoever.</hi> However one may conclude from the Forces they had at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> that they were not very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; becauſe though but Four hundred <hi>Spartans</hi> out of Seven hundred, and a thouſand <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were ſlain, yet this Loſs was ſo great, that they were forc'd to take in all under ſeventy years of age to recruit their Army; and their Men were ſo exhauſted, that they had ſcarce enough wherewith to ſupply the neceſſary Offices of Government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spartans</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which laſt contained two and thirty men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> ſo that a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> conſiſted of Five hundred and twelve. <hi>Xenophon</hi> and the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:58267:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Thucydides</hi> differ in their Computations, for in theſe things no certain Number can be aſſign'd; and ſo the <hi>Roman Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as our Regiment was more or leſs, having no determinate Number. Each <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> had its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Colonel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom was the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonel. The <hi>Phalanx</hi> at this time was not taken for any certain Number, but ſometimes for a <hi>Battalion,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the whole body of Foot. The eldeſt <hi>Polemarch</hi> was Lieutenant General of the Army, and after <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> was ſlain in the Battel of <hi>Leuctra, Dino</hi> the <hi>Polemarch</hi> commanded in Chief. Beſides theſe there were three hundred Horſe, and ſix hundred <hi>Sciritae,</hi> which were a a choſen Band, that were placed in the left Wing.</p>
            <p>The whole Army was Conducted by one of their Kings, who had an abſolute and uncontrollable Power, till <hi>Agis</hi> was ſo unfortunate as to make an haſty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then they aſſign'd him a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, without whoſe joynt Conſent he could not act: Or elſe by a General who had the Title of <hi>Harmostes,</hi> which was given alſo to the Governour of a Town. If the King was a <hi>Minor,</hi> then the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Protector,</hi> commanded for
<pb facs="tcp:58267:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>him. Before an Expedition was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the King performed ſome preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifices, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and took the Field near Harveſt, that being the moſt likely-time to draw the Enemy out of their Fortreſſes to a Battel, becauſe they would come forth to defend their Corn: If they did not, the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did not ſit down before their Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; it being forbidden them by their Laws to beſiege Towns, becauſe any kind of men by the benefit of a Wall might reſiſt the moſt couragious, and a valiant Man might be deſtroyed by an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Woman.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> therefore being leſs expert in Seiges than any other of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they would not ſuffer any of their Neighbours to Fortifie, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pull'd down their Walls by force, or oblig'd them thereto by Treaty. Though they had a fair pretence that no ſtrong Holds ſhould be built, leſt the <hi>Perſian</hi> if he Invaded <hi>Greece</hi> any more, ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf thereof, and gain firm footing in their Country. I don't find that the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> had any formal ways of beſieging Towns, further than the raiſing a Wall about the Place they beleagur'd, whereby they cut off Proviſions and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors
<pb facs="tcp:58267:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the Beſieged. Their Engines were but ordinary, and rather invented occaſionally than uſed commonly. By the account we have of the famous Siege of <hi>Plataeae,</hi> we may Collect what their Methods were in others: It was at firſt Inveſted by the <hi>Peloponeſians</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans;</hi> but the former marched home, and left the Siege to the management of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who built two Walls of Brick ſixteen Foot wide, like the Lines of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travallation and Circumvallation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which they poſted themſelves: After that they raiſed a <hi>Cavallier,</hi> or high Mount to over-look the Town. On the contrary, the Beſiged erected a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Wall upon the other of Stone, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the Enemies Proſpect into the City, and ran up another of Brick for a Retrenchment, if the outermoſt ſhould be taken. Whilſt the <hi>Thebans</hi> raiſed their <hi>Cavallier,</hi> the Beſieged carried a Mine to it, and took away the Earth as faſt as the Beſiegers brought it, and thereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the advance of the Work.</p>
            <p>They had alſo another Device in the Attacking of Towns, which was to carry a great deal of Combuſtible matter near the Walls, that they ſet on fire, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Enemy from their Poſts with

Towns were taken three ways, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by Aſſault, by Surrender, when the Garriſon and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants deliver'd up the Place before the Enemy ſat down before it: to this latter is oppoſed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy made Works, and took the Place by Siege.</p>
            <p>When the Armies were in the Field, they threw up a Trench, and planted Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizado's upon it, to ſecure themſelves from the Surprize of an Enemy. The Generals drew up their Battel in the form of a Wedge, and in an Oblong Figure, which ſometimes was with the longeſt ſide to the Front, and other-whiles the longeſt ſide in depth; they drew up ſometimes in one, and ſometimes in another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they thought it moſt for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. When the <hi>Battalions</hi> were made deep, or form'd into a Wedge; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to break through the Enemies Battel and to rout them: Though theſe Forms had their Inconveniences; the firſt eſpecially, becauſe they being many in
<pb facs="tcp:58267:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>File, and few in Front, the Enemies that Out-winged them, might Flank them, and fall in at thoſe Intervals which were made by the eager and unequal preſſing forward of the foremoſt Ranks, and ruine their Body. Neither would it hold in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Reaſon, that becauſe a Wedge of Iron would rive a Block, that therefore one of men ſhould pierce a <hi>Battalion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Leuctra</hi> were few in Front, and fifty deep, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing if they made ſo ſtrong an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on thoſe about the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King as to Rout them, that they ſhould Defeat the reſt with eaſe; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it hapned. The Heavy-arm'd men were Marſhalled ſo as to receive the Light-arm'd men and Targetiers within them; (the ancients Heavy-arm'd men being like our Pike-men) whereby they who had the riſing-ground, obtain'd a conſiderable advantage over thoſe that were drawn up in a Plain: Which <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſybulus</hi> took notice of to his Souldiers, when he encouraged them to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Thirty Tyrants; telling them that the Enemy ſtood on a Level, and none but thoſe who were in the Front could make uſe of their Darts and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whilſt they ſtanding on an Hill,
<pb facs="tcp:58267:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>could employ all hands, and bring every one to fight.</p>
            <p>Before the Battel began, an <hi>Hymn</hi> was ſung to animate the Souldiers, and the like after by thoſe who had obtained the Victory. Moſt of the <hi>Greeks</hi> when they engaged ſet up a ſhout, and ran with a full Cry upon the Enemy, but the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> differ'd from them in this, for they had Pipers diſpoſed up and down in convenient Stations, who were to play when the Army moved, that the Souldiers might pace according to the Modulation of the Pipes. And whereas the fury and noiſe affected by others was to beget Courage in them, and hurry them on againſt the Enemy; the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> advanced, and ſtruck a terrour into their <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> with their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Gravity. The greateſt diſgrace amongſt them was to loſe their Shields, ſuch being branded with the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Nor was it leſs reproachful to fly, as may be gathered from the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram</hi> about an Heroick Woman, who meeting her Son running out of the Field, killed him with this Elogy; that ſhe could forget the Affection of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whilſt he forgot the Duty of a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian.</hi> Their Education and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb facs="tcp:58267:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>made them ſo terrible, that none cared to engage with them, they being Men poſitively reſolv'd to Conquer, or to die. When a Victory was obtain'd, the Conquerors went to the place where the Battel began, ſang an <hi>Hymn,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Trophy as a Monument of their Succeſs, and delivered the Slain upon Truce; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> were very careful to beſtow burial upon their Dead, not only out of Decency, but a ſuperſtitious Conceit, that the Souls of the Dead were not at reſt till the Bodies were interr'd.</p>
            <p>In order to the making of Peace, there was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ceſſation of Arms, till ſuch time as they treated of a Truce or Peace, though generally a Truce or temporary Peace was made; as that of <hi>Euboea</hi> for thirty years; a ſecond between the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> for fifty years; and another for an hundred: The Forms of their Peace were engraven on Pillars, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Treaties were in the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol;</hi> and if any Party violated them, the breach hereof was under-written.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenian Militia</hi> differed from the <hi>Spartan:</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> being Lords of the Sea, and poſſeſt of many Iſlands, were able to bring a far more numerous Army into the Field than the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58267:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>or any one Eſtate of <hi>Greece. Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> exciting his Country-men to purſue the War vigorouſly againſt the <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians,</hi> tells them that they had thirteen thouſand Heavy-arm'd men, beſides ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand more diſperſt up and down in the Gariſons and Frontiers; to which if we add the proportion of Light-arm'd men and Targetiers, they will make up a very powerful Army. The Forces of the <hi>Athenians</hi> were called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as thoſe of the <hi>Spartans</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Auxiliaries:</hi> They were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the Tribes which were ten in number; for amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> the Diviſion by Tribes was accommodated to the Military as well as Civil Government. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in this Hiſtory, were the Captains of the Heavy-arm'd men. They had alſo a ſtanding Body of Horſe, not exceeding a thouſand, to which were aſſigned forty Talents, or ſeven thouſand five hundred pound Sterling for their-year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintenance. The <hi>Cavalry</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by two <hi>Hipparchs</hi> or <hi>Colonels,</hi> who had ten <hi>Phylarchs</hi> or <hi>Captains</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to them; becauſe theſe were raiſed by the Tribes as the Heavy-arm'd men.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58267:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>As for the Naval Forces, the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> excell'd at Sea, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did at Land: for <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown the <hi>Perſian</hi> Fleet in the great Sea-fight at <hi>Salamis,</hi> encouraged his Country-men to apply themſelves to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Affairs. They followed his Counſels, and in the ſpace of fifty years, partly by their own Induſtry, and partly by the natural advantage of their Situation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Sovereignty of the Sea.</p>
            <p>During the time of this War, the <hi>Greeks</hi> made uſe of Gallies, which were Ships of conſiderable Force. The firſt Gally was built at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> having ſmall Veſſels before, called from the number of their Oars; as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from thirty, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from fifty Oars. The Gallies now uſed in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> are vaſtly different from thoſe of the Ancients, and ſeveral Learned Men who have written on this Subject; as <hi>Bayfius, Joſ. Scaliger,</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on <hi>Euſebius; Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echius</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Vegetius, Scheffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Palmerius</hi> have varied very much in their Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palmerius</hi> brings the Authority of an ancient Author, Printed with <hi>Aelian,</hi> to prove that Ships terminated in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are denominated
<pb facs="tcp:58267:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the number of their Oars, and thoſe that end in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Gally, from the ſeveral Banks and Diſtinctions of Rowers, ſetting one above another in height. Yet we muſt not underſtand it ſo, as that the Rowers ſat in diſtinct Decks, becauſe <hi>Ptolemy Philopator</hi>'s Ship that had forty Banks of Oars, had but forty eight Cubits, or ſeventy two Feet in height from the water; ſo that if theſe had ſat in diſtinct Decks, the men muſt have been <hi>Pygmies,</hi> each Deck not having two feet in height. Neither were the Rowers placed above one another in a Perpendicular; for then as great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will remain ſtill. If therefore we ſuppoſe the Banks to have been placed obliquely, and to have roſe gradually like Stairs, and allow each Bank one Foot, and ¼ <hi>Ptolemie</hi>'s Ship of forty Banks, and ſeventy two Feet, will require but fifty Feet, and there will remain twenty two for other uſes.</p>
            <p>The Rowers in a Gally were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by three Names, the Lowermoſt were called <hi>Thalamaces,</hi> and had the ſhorteſt Oars, the middle-moſt <hi>Zygitae,</hi> and the uppermoſt <hi>Thranitae,</hi> who had larger Oars than the other two, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more pay, as the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58267:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the ſixth Book obſerves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> wholly neglected the Sea, being prohibited by their Laws to learn the Cuſtoms and Manners of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; leſt Foreigners by their Commerce ſhould Import as well their Vices as Merchandizes. Nor did they ſet out a Fleet till they were made ſenſible of the advantage the Enemies had, and the Damage they themſelves ſuſtained for the want of one.</p>
            <p>The Sea-ſervice amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> was eſteem'd of leſſer Dignity than the Land, and the Sea-men were lookt upon as a contemptible ſort of men: Nay, the <hi>Athenians</hi> themſelves gave the Command of Ships to land Captains, only taking care to procure them Maſters, which were expert Sea-men. The Ships were mann'd with ſeveral ſorts of men; as Rowers, Sea-men, who Navigated the Ships, and handed the Sails; <hi>Epibatae,</hi> or Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Sea-ſervice, and Heavy-arm'd men, which laſt were employ'd at Sea, becauſe they ſeldom fighting at a diſtance, grapled, and made a ſtanding Fight of it, as at Land. I have not met any where with the number of Men, their Ships carried; though I ſuppoſe (if we except the Rowers) they had fewer in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:58267:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>than thoſe in our time, becauſe their Men did not fight between the Decks.</p>
            <p>The Sea-men's Pay varied according to the Times and Exigencies of State; <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſays, They had a <hi>Drachma,</hi> or Seven Pence Half-penny a Day; but we find in the Firſt Book of this Hiſtory, that <hi>Lyſander</hi> moved <hi>Cyrus</hi> to encreaſe the Seamens Pay, and raiſe it from Three <hi>Oboli</hi> to a <hi>Drachma,</hi> which contained ſix; ſhewing that the Seamen would come into the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Service, and deſert the <hi>Athenian;</hi> becauſe they always reſort thither where moſt Pay is to be had. At laſt, <hi>Lyſander</hi> prevailed with <hi>Cyrus</hi> to raiſe the Pay to Four <hi>Oboli,</hi> which was Five Pence <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> had not always one Admiral, but ſometimes more; as when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> went out, they had Three, and when he was put out of Commiſſion, there were Ten choſen. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had one Admiral, called <hi>Navarchus,</hi> who had under him a Vice-Admiral, called <hi>Epiſtoleus,</hi> that Commanded in abſence of the other.</p>
            <p>When the Admirals deſign'd to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, they left their Main-Maſts and Sails aſhore, becauſe they were an hindrance to them in time of Fight, eſpecially when
<pb facs="tcp:58267:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>they rowed againſt the Wind. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Engaging was to bruſh off the Enemies Oars, whereby the Ship was diſabled, and to give each other the ſhock: whereupon the Prows of the Ships were fortified with ſtrong pieces of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Braſs; they always ſtriving to ſtrike a Ship on her ſide, that being the weakeſt part of her, and he that was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, endeavoured to receive the ſtroak on his Prow, or decline it.</p>
            <p>There were three Figures that the Fleets uſually drew up in, which they did upon ſeveral accounts, according as they ſaw it moſt advantagious. There was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Half-Moon; in this they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſtrongeſt Ships in both the Horns: If the Ships were nimble, they drew up <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in a Line, or Series, that they might ſurround the Enemy; ſometimes in a cloſe Body, and that was when they were bad Sailers: becauſe by this Figure they could ſuſtain the ſhock of the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ships, that they might not break through them. Other-whiles they rang'd their Ships in a mixt Form; ſome in a Body, and ſome in a Line or ſingle Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, called <gap reason="foreign">

And from that time the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> encreaſing their Power, and Forces, the reſt of the leſſer States ſided with the one, or other of them, according as their Inclinations or Intereſts led them. But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> employing their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58267:25"/>Arms at Land, engaged thoſe they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, only to conform their Government to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Model, not exacting any Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from them. On the contrary, the <hi>Athenians</hi> by the Encouragement of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> having ſet out a Fleet, reduced with it the Iſlands of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, improv'd their Commerce, and obliged their Allys to pay certain Impoſitions, and Taxes; whereby they became exceeding Wealthy, and Powerful.</p>
               <p>The growth of the <hi>Athenians</hi> impoſed a neceſſity on the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> of making War: The pretence of which was <hi>Epidam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Corcyreans:</hi> Who growing firſt Rich, and then Factious, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſeveral of their Citizens. The <hi>Exiles</hi> joyning with the <hi>Barbarians</hi> brought the <hi>Epidamnians</hi> ſo low, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſend for Succour to <hi>Corcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> their Mother-City. But, the <hi>Corcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> rejecting their requeſt, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht Meſſengers to the Oracle to inquire, Whether they might not ſurrender to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as their Founders: Becauſe <hi>Phalius</hi> that ſetled the Colony was a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Oracle anſwered them, They might, accordingly they profered their Submiſſion to them, and they readily accepted it, out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58267:25"/>of hatred to the <hi>Corcyreans;</hi> who were a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Colony, but had caſt off their Founders, and in the publick Solemnities did not according to the Cuſtom of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies make uſe of a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Arch-Prieſt, but becoming by their Wealth, and Naval Forces equal to the moſt powerful States of <hi>Greece,</hi> deſpiſed them.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> going with a Fleet againſt <hi>Epidamnus</hi> blockt it up, and beat the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that came to the relief of the place, and took it the ſame day.</p>
               <p>The Summer following, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> reſolving to revenge their former diſgrace, made very great Preparations, obliging the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> to enter into a League de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might not break theirs with the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſians:</hi> Yet the <hi>Athenians</hi> foreſaw, that they ſhould be engag'd in a War with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> becauſe the former would not let ſuch an important place as <hi>Corcyra,</hi> that had ſo conſiderable a Naval Force, and lay ſo convenient for Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> be an Acceſſion to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Corinthians</hi> put to Sea with a Fleet of <hi>150</hi> Sail, and overthrew the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> in an Engagement, ſoon after breaking
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58267:26"/>with the <hi>Athenians</hi> for aſſiſting the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyreans.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſuſpecting there would be a Rupture, that they might be before-hand with them, Commanded the <hi>Potideans</hi> their Tributaries, and a Colony of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to demoliſh their Walls towards <hi>Pallene,</hi> to give Hoſtages, to expel their Magiſtrates ſent by the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and not to receive them for the Future. When the <hi>Potideans</hi> could get no abatement of theſe Terms propos'd by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they went with the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and obtain'd an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that in Caſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> made War upon the <hi>Potideans,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> would enter <hi>Attica</hi> with an Army. The <hi>Potideans</hi> having ſtrengthned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Alliances of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours revolted; whereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> went with an Army, and beſieged them.</p>
               <p>The noiſe of this Siege brought the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Ambaſſadors, and ſeveral others to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> with Complaints againſt the <hi>Athenians.</hi> After a full hearing of the Caſe the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> induced by the apprehenſions they had of the <hi>Athenians</hi> Power, who had already ſubdued a great part of <hi>Greece,</hi> declared, that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were the Aggreſſors. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> alſo to make the War appear more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58267:26"/>ſpecious on their ſide, ſent Ambaſſadors to expoſtulate with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to require them to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Potidea;</hi> and permit <hi>Aegina</hi> to be governed by its own Laws: Eſpecially to revoke the Decree prohibiting the <hi>Megareans</hi> the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ports, and Markets.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were debating in the Council, <hi>Pericles</hi> an eloquent Perſon, and the greateſt Man in <hi>Athens</hi> of his time, oppoſed their Demands: Shewing that theſe were no ſufficient grounds for a War, and that if they yeilded in this, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> would impoſe more upon them: That the Confederates had many different Intereſts, that their Counſels were divided, and came not to any ſudden reſolve. On the contrary, that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had a conſiderable Fleet, wherewith they could make frequent Deſcents, and give the Enemy a powerful Diverſion. And becauſe their Strength conſiſted chiefly in Iſlands, having only <hi>Attica</hi> that lay open to the Depredations of the Enemy, they could not ſuſtain ſo great loſſes by Land, as the Confederates. Therefore this Anſwer ſhould be return'd them, That they would permit the <hi>Megareans</hi> the Freedom of their Ports, and Markets: Provided the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would grant the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58267:27"/>and their Allys (who were <hi>Aliens</hi> in <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>) the Priviledges of their own Subjects. That they would restore the Cities to their Liberty, if they did enjoy the ſaid Liberty, before the League was made. Provided alſo, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would do the like to the Cities under their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and not oblige them to conform to the Model of their Government: And that they deſired to adjust theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences by Treaty, as being unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a War, but ready to defend themſelves againſt one.</p>

               <p>When he arrived, all the People flock'd out of the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> and City to the Ships, admiring and longing to ſee <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> crying, He was the braveſt man of their Country, that he only was declared to have been unjuſtly baniſhed, being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented by thoſe that were of leſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and Eloquence than himſelf, and that ſerved themſelves of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That he always promoted the

Such a man as he (ſaid they) needed no Innovations, nor change of Government, but that he could prefer himſelf by the favour of the People, before any of his years, and not come ſhort of thoſe that were older; and appear the ſame man to his Enemies, that he was before.

               <p>The Aſſembly ſuffering none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, declared him <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of all their Forces, as one that could maintain the former Grandeur of his Countrey.

I blame them for perſwading their Colleagues to write to the Senate and People: That they had ordered <hi>Theramenes</hi> and <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> with forty ſeven ſail of Ships to take up the Ship-wrackt men, who ne'r ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their Orders; Whereby the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of a few has involved all in a common guilt, and they for their late humanity are brought in danger of their lives, by the ſecret Practiſes of theſe and ſome others. Which yet they need not apprehend, provided you will do them Right and Juſtice. For thus you ſhall be well informed of the Truth, and have no cauſe to repent of your Proceedings; nor find that you have committed the two grand Offences both againſt the Gods, and your own ſelves. I offer ſuch things to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58267:61"/>on, wherein neither I nor any elſe can impoſe upon you; and if you find them guilty, you may inflict what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment you pleaſe either on them each ſeverally, or on all joyntly. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow them one day, if not longer, to make their defence in, that you may not give more credit to others than your ſelves. You (my Lords) know all that <hi>Canonus</hi> his Law is very ſevere, which ſays, the Priſoner for Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State ſhall plead in Irons, and if convict thereof, he ſhall be put to death, and flung into the <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum,</hi> his eſtate ſhall be confiſcated, and a tenth part thereof ſhall be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Minerva.</hi> I move that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals may be tried upon this Statute, and begin firſt if you pleaſe with my Couſin <hi>Pericles.</hi> For I ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to value him above my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Or if you had rather, let them be tried upon the Statute againſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Perſons, and Traytors; <hi>which ſays,</hi> that if any Perſon ſhall commit Treaſon againſt the Government, or ſhall ſteal any holy things, and upon a legal trial be convict of the ſame, That he ſhall have no<note n="*" place="margin">There was a Law that no Traytor ſhould be buried publickly, <hi>Thucy.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58267:62"/>be proſecuted upon which you pleaſe of theſe two, and divide the day into three parts: the firſt, for you to meet, and them to be impleaded in, the next for them to make their Defence in, and the laſt to vote whether they be guilty, or not guilty. Thus (my Lords) the Delinquents ſhall be ſeverely puniſht, the Innocent acquitted, and not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any form of Juſtice. So ſhall you proceed according to Law, and your Oath; and do not conſpire with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by condemning thoſe men without an Hearing, and contrary to Juſtice, who have come off victoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and taken ſeventy Sail of Ships. What are you afraid of that you make ſo much haſt? Is it leſt you ſhould not have power to acquit or condemn any, without you had proceeded in an extrajudicial way? Like <hi>Callixenus,</hi> who moved that all the Admirals might be tried by one Suffrage. But if you condemn any innocent Perſon to death, whereof you may afterwards repent: conſider what a lamentable thing, and of what ill conſequence it will be to take away the lives of men without Forms of Juſtice. 'Tis very hard, when you allowed <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> (who firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58267:62"/>to ſubvert the Government, and after that betrayed <hi>Oenoe</hi> to the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> your Enemies) what day he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make his Defence in, and all things elſe according to Law; to deny the Admirals the ſame, who have van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht your Enemies, and fully anſwered your Expectations.

Which of theſe things have they not well, and fully diſcharged. 'Tis reaſonable then that thoſe only ſhould be accountable for Miſcarriages in the Fight, who were to engage; and they only queſtioned for not taking the men up, that had Orders ſo to do, but obſerved them not: So much I can ſay for both, that the Storm hindred them from executing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's Commands.</q>

                  <q>This can be proved by thoſe that were ſaved by accident, amongſt whom is one of our Admirals, that eſcaped out of a Ship which ſunk; and though he wanted help himſelf, yet he is now condemned by the ſame Suffrage with thoſe that obeyed not their Orders. But far be it from you (my Lords) to deal with them for their Victory and good Fortune, as if they had been vanquiſht, and unſucceſsful.

               <p>THe Soldiers that were with <hi>Eteoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> in <hi>Chius,</hi> lived all Summer time upon the ripe Fruits; and wrought in the Countrey for Wages. But when
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58267:65"/>Winter came, and they had no Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but were naked and barefoot: they met together and deliberated about ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Chius.</hi> Thoſe that liked the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, determined to wear a Reed, that they might diſcern how ſtrong their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was. <hi>Eteonicus</hi> when he heard of the Conſpiracy was at a ſtand, not knowing how to comport himſelf in this Affair, becauſe there was ſo great a number of<note n="*" place="margin">Like our Green Ribband men.</note> Reedmen. For it ſeemed dangerous to call them openly to an Account, leſt turning Enemies, aad taking up Arms, they ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when they had prevailed, put all things in confuſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides he conſidered that it would be an horrid thing to deſtroy ſo many of the Confederates, that he ſhould thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the Obloquy of the reſt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and render the Army diſaffected to the Service. Whereupon taking along with him fifteen men armed with Daggers, he walkt through the Town, and meeting with a man that had ſore eyes coming out of a Surgeon's Shop, he killed him. A diſturbance hap'ning upon't, and ſome asking for what the man was killed: <hi>Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onicus</hi> commanded them to inform them, that it was for wearing a Reed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58267:65"/>as ſoon as the Order was given out, all that wore Reeds threw them away; every one that heard it, ſearing he ſhould not convey them away ſoon enough.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Eteonicus</hi> aſſembled the <hi>Chians,</hi> and commanded them to raiſe money, that the Sea-men might receive their Wages, and be kept from engaging in any new Conſpiracy. When they had made a Contribution, he commanded his men on board, and going on board every Ship himſelf, encouraged and heartned them up, diſſembling the loſs the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> had ſuſtained at <hi>Arginuſae,</hi> and gave them a Months pay a man.</p>
               <p>A while after the <hi>Chians,</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates aſſembled at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and conſulted about ſending Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> to give an account of the preſent Juncture of Affairs, and to deſire that <hi>Lyſander</hi> might be Admiral; who had gained great reputation amongſt the Conſederates the laſt time he was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, by the Victory he obtained in the Sea-fight at <hi>Notium.</hi> Accordingly there were Ambaſſadors diſpatcht, and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from <hi>Cyrus</hi> in company with them, upon the ſame Errand. The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> granted, that <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58267:66"/>Vice-Admiral, but appointed <hi>Aracus</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, for their Law does not allow that the ſame Perſon ſhould have that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand twice. The Fleet was delivered up to <hi>Lyſander</hi> at the end of the twenty ſixth Year of the War. The ſame Year <hi>Cyrus</hi> killed <hi>Antoboeſaces</hi> and <hi>Mitraeus</hi> the Sons of <hi>Darius</hi> his Siſter, Daughter to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who was Father to <hi>Darius,</hi> for keeping their hands within their ſleeve, when they met him; which reſpect the <hi>Perſians</hi> pay to their King only. The ſleeve reaches ſomewhat below the hand,<note place="margin">Like the Cuſtom of being led in to the Grand Seignior.</note> ſo that nobody can do any miſchief, whiles he keeps his hand within it. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenes</hi> and his Wife repreſented to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> how horrid a thing it would be to connive at ſo great an Inſolency. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King feigned himſelf ſick, and diſpatcht Meſſengers for <hi>Cyrus</hi> to come up to him.</p>
               <p>The next Year <hi>Lyſander</hi> came to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">XXVII. Year of the <hi>Pelop.</hi> War, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius Archon.</hi> When <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylas</hi> was <hi>Ephorus,</hi> and <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Archon</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi>

He not only refitted theſe Ships, but built more at <hi>Antan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus,</hi> and went to demand money of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> who told him, that he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſt all he had from the King with a great deal more, and ſhew'd him what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58267:66"/>Admiral had received, notwithſtanding he gave him ſome. <hi>Lyſander</hi> taking the mony appointed Captains of Gallies, and pay'd the Sea-men their Wages. In like manner the <hi>Athenian</hi> Admirals equipped their Fleet at <hi>Samos.</hi> About this time, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> upon the arrival of a Meſſenger from his Father, ſent for <hi>Lyſander,</hi> telling him, that his Father was ſick, and that he had commanded him to come to him, though he was marcht at that time to <hi>Thamneria</hi> in <hi>Media</hi> not far from the <hi>Caduſii</hi> that were Borderers, and had made a defection, being gone thither to reduce them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lyſander</hi> came, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would not yield, that he ſhould fight the <hi>Athenians</hi> by Sea, unleſs he were much Superiour to them in Shipping, Telling him more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that the King, and he, had money enough, to equip a powerful Fleet for ſuch a Deſign. Afterwards he conſigned him the Tribute of the Cities, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to himſelf, and what money could be ſpared beſides, profeſſing withal the kindneſs he had for the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> but in particular for <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and ſo went up to his Father. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> had delivered him all his Concerns, and was entred on his Journey towards his ſick Father, that had ſent for him: <hi>Lyſander</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58267:67"/>paid off the Army and ſet ſail to <hi>Cerami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> a Bay in <hi>Caria.</hi> There he attackt a Town in League with the <hi>Athenians</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cedraeae:</hi> and the day after taking it by Storm, made Slaves of the Inhabitants, who were half <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and from thence he parted for <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſetting out of <hi>Samos,</hi> harraſſed the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Countrey, going alſo againſt <hi>Chius,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus:</hi> and when they had choſen <hi>Menander, Tydeus,</hi> and <hi>Cephiſodotus,</hi> beſides thoſe Admirals that were already in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they made preparations to meet the Enemy. In the mean while <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſailed from <hi>Rhodes</hi> along the Coaſt of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> to obſerve what Ships came that way, and to go againſt thoſe Cities that had revolted. The <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſtood more out to Sea towards <hi>Chius,</hi> becauſe <hi>Aſia</hi> was an Enemies Countrey. <hi>Lyſander</hi> parted from <hi>Abydus</hi> to <hi>Lampſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> which was in league with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> When the <hi>Abydenians,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forces under the Command of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> came to him by Land; they attackt the Town, and took it by Storm, and the Soldiers had the plunder of it, being very rich and well ſtored with Corn and other Proviſions; but <hi>Lyſander</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:58267:67"/>diſmiſt all the Freemen. The <hi>Athenians</hi> followed him directly, and put into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at <hi>Eleus</hi> in the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> with an hundred and eighty Sail of Ships: whilſt they were at Dinner News was brought them of <hi>the loſs</hi> of <hi>Lampſacus.</hi> Upon which they parted immediately for <hi>Seſtos,</hi> where they took in ſome Proviſions, and went from thence to <hi>Aegoſpotamos,</hi> over againſt <hi>Lampſacus,</hi> which is about fifteen Furlongs from the <hi>helleſpont,</hi> and there they Supped.</p>
               <p>The ſame Night towards Morning <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> made a Sign to the Soldiers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves, and come on board.

As ſoon as the Sun was up, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ranged their Fleet in order before the Port, and faced the Enemy with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to engage. But when <hi>Lyſander</hi> came not out to them, and the day was far ſpent, they ſailed back again to <hi>Aego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotamos.</hi> Upon which <hi>Lyſander</hi> ordered out the nimbleſt Ships to follow the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> to obſerve how they behaved themſelves, when they went aſhore, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58267:68"/>then to come back, and give him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: nor did he permit any of his men to go aſhore till theſe Ships returned.</p>
               <p>This he did for four days together, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time the <hi>Athenians</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bore up to him. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> when he viewed from his Caſtle the <hi>Athenians</hi> lying by the Shore, near no Town, fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Proviſions from <hi>Sestos,</hi> that was fifteen Furlongs from the Fleet; but the Enemy in Port, and near a Town, from whence they were furniſht with all neceſſaries; went and informed them that they had but bad riding, and adviſed them to go to <hi>Sestos,</hi> where they might have the accommodation both of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and a Town. When you are there (ſaid he) you may fight the Enemy, when you think fit your ſelves. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals (eſpecially <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi>) bid him go about his buſineſs, for now they commanded, and not he; ſo he went his way. On the fifth day that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had thus conſtantly bore up with <hi>Lyſander,</hi> he commanded thoſe he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to obſerve their Fleet, that when they diſcovered the Enemy gone aſhore, and ſtragled on the <hi>Cherſoneſe</hi> (which they contemning <hi>Lyſander</hi> for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to engage them, did every day
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58267:68"/>more and more, fetching their Proviſions a great way off) they ſhould return back to him, and hale up a Shield when they were half Seas over. They obeyed his Command. Then <hi>Lyſander</hi> having taken <hi>Thorax</hi> with the Land-Army on board, made a Sign to ſet Sail with all expedition.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Conon</hi> ſaw the Enemy bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with him, he made a Sign for his men to come on board, and ſuccour him with all poſſible diligence; but the men were ſo ſtragled, that ſome Ships had not above two Rowers, ſome one, ſome none at all.

               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> aſhore got together in a Body, and threw themſelves into the Garriſons. <hi>Conon</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Athenians</hi> totally defeated, fled with nine Sail, and ſtood for <hi>Abarnis,</hi> a <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Lampſacus;</hi> and taking from thence the Main-ſails of <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Ships, he went himſelf with eight Sail to <hi>Evagoras</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but the <hi>Paralus</hi> parted for <hi>Athens</hi> with the News of what had paſſed. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> carried to <hi>Lampſacus</hi> the Ships, Priſoners, and the reſt of the Spoil, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58267:69"/>with <hi>Philocles</hi> and <hi>Adimantus</hi> two Admirals that were his Priſoners.

After this <hi>Lyſander</hi> called the Confederates to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bid them Conſult what was to be done with the Priſoners. There were a great many Accuſations brought againſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for their former villainous Actions; for having determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to cut off every Priſoner's right hand, if they had gotten the Victory at Sea: and for throwing down a Precipice the men they had taken on board two Gallies, the one a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> the other an <hi>Andrian;</hi> being ſet on by the cruel advice of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> Several other things alſo were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, and 'twas reſolved that all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners who were <hi>Athenians</hi> ſhould be put to death, except <hi>Adimantus;</hi> becauſe he only at the Council of War oppoſed the cutting off of hands, which was the reaſon that ſome accuſed him for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fleet. <hi>Lyſander</hi> asking <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> that threw the <hi>Andrians</hi> and <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> down the Precipice, what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for being the Inventor of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> hackt him in pieces.</p>

               <p>When he had ſetled Affairs at <hi>Lampſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> he went to <hi>Byzantium</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where being received by the Townſmen within their Walls, he ſent away the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Garriſon with Paſſes. At that time thoſe that betrayed <hi>Byzantium</hi> to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> fled to <hi>Pontus,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Athens,</hi> where they were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized. <hi>Lyſander,</hi> when he ſaw any Soldiers of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Garriſons, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Athenian</hi> beſides, ſent them all to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> giving Paſſes to thoſe that ſailed thither, and to no place elſe, concluding that the greater the Multitudes were that flockt to the City and <hi>Piraeus,</hi> the ſooner they would want Proviſions. Therefore leaving <hi>Sthenelaus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> to be Governour of <hi>Byzantium</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> he went to <hi>Lampſacus,</hi> and refitted his Fleet.</p>

                  <hi>Paralus</hi> arrived at <hi>Athens</hi> in the Night, upon the firſt report of the Calamity, the ſad News was conveyed by a continual Lamentation from the <hi>Piraeus;</hi> up the Long Walls, on to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one informing another: So that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſlept that Night, not only bewailing thoſe that were ſlain, but their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a great deal more; reflecting, how they had treated the <hi>Melians</hi> a Colony of

               <p>And thus whiles the <hi>Athenians</hi> were employed about theſe Affairs, <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> came from the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> to <hi>Lesbos</hi> with two hundred Sail of Ships, and ſettled the Government at <hi>Mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> as he had done at other Towns, and ſent <hi>Eteonicus</hi> to the Coaſt of <hi>Thrace</hi> with ten Gallies, to reduce all the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wns there to the Obedience of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</hi> After the Sea-fight, the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi> deſerted the <hi>Athenians,</hi> except the <hi>Samians,</hi> who had murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Chief men, and poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Government. <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſent to acquaint <hi>Agis,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Decelea,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that he was coming with two hundred Sail of Ships. Whereupon the whole Multitude of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> except the <hi>Argives,</hi> went out to receive him by order of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the other King.</p>
               <p>When they were all aſſembled, he

After that he waſted <hi>Salamis,</hi> and came to an Anchor in the <hi>Piraeus</hi> with an hundred and fifty Sail, hindring any Ships from coming into Port. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> blockt up by Sea and Land; knew not what meaſures to take, being deſtitute of a Fleet, of Friends, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; thinking it was now come to their turn to ſuffer the ills they had infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the People of other Towns, which was not by way of revenge, but inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and for no other cauſe, but that they had joyned with the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Thereupon they advanced thoſe that had been diſgraced, and ſo held out the Siege, and though many were ſtarved to death, yet no mention was made of capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

               <p>When the <hi>Ephori</hi> underſtood their Meſſage to be the ſame, that it was to <hi>Agis,</hi> they commanded them to depart immediately, and think of fairer Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, if they really ſtood in need of a Peace.

               <p>In this Juncture, <hi>Theramenes</hi> declared in the Aſſembly, that if they would ſend him to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> he would diſcover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

After he was diſpatcht, he ſtay'd with <hi>Lyſander</hi> above three Months, expecting when the <hi>Athenians</hi> (now their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons failing) would comply with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Four Months after he returned, and reported in the Aſſembly that <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had detained him till that time, and now adviſed him to go to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> becauſe it was not in his power to grant their demands, but the <hi>Ephori's.</hi> Upon that he was choſen one of the ten Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries to <hi>Lacedemon. Lyſander</hi> ſent <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Exile thither in Company of ſome <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them that he had made <hi>Theramenes</hi> this Anſwer, That the Power of War and Peace was veſted in the <hi>Ephori.</hi> When <hi>Theramenes</hi> and the other Ambaſſadors arrived at <hi>Sellaſia,</hi> 'twas demanded what Powers they had. They declared they had full inſtructions to treat of Peace. Then the <hi>Ephori</hi> ordered them to be introduced, and at their coming called an Aſſembly wherein the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> chiefly, with ſeveral other <hi>Greeks,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the making Peace with the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:58267:72"/>and urged their total Extirpation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> replied they would not deſtroy a <hi>Greek</hi> City, that had done ſo great Service to <hi>Greece</hi> in the moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical times; but made Peace with them on theſe Conditions; That the Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls and <hi>Piraeus</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed, that they ſhould deliver up all their Ships but twelve, that they ſhould reſtore their Exiles, that they ſhould make a League Offenſive and Defenſive with the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> and ſerve them in all their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, both by Sea and Land. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenes</hi> and his Collegues brought theſe Articles of Peace to <hi>Athens;</hi> and when they came into Town a great Multitude flockt about them, fearing they returned without effect, though their neceſſity could admit of no delay, by reaſon abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People periſht with Famine. The day following the Ambaſſadors declared upon what terms the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would make Peace. <hi>Theramenes</hi> ſpoke the firſt, and adviſed them to comply with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and demoliſh the Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls. Whilſt it was debated, the major part approved it, and it was reſolved that the Peace ſhould be accepted. After that <hi>Lyſander</hi> came up the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> the Exiles returned and the Walls were demoliſhed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58267:72"/>with great eagerneſs, the Muſick playing the while, and all imagined that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Greece</hi> might be dated from that day.

               <p>Formerly <hi>Critias</hi> and <hi>Theramenes</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſtrict correſpondency and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but when the firſt (having been baniſht by the People) began to thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blood; <hi>Theramenes</hi> oppoſed him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it was not fit, that any ſhould be put to death, for being eſteemed by the People, provided they had never injured men of worth and honeſty.

               <p>Thereupon <hi>Critias</hi> and the reſt of the Thirty, being jealous of <hi>Theramenes,</hi> leſt he ſhould become popular; choſe three thouſand to participate of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>The reſt of the Thirty muſtering the three thouſand in the Market, and thoſe that were not of that number in another place, they commanded them to arm themſelves.

               <p>After this, they, as if they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Licence of doing what they liſted, put ſome to death out of malice, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their money; reſolving to ſeize all the Aliens,<note n="*" place="margin">Our Sheriffs lock up the Houſes of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Treaſon, and ſecure the Goods till the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al be over, when they are to be reſtored to the Owner if cleared, elſe to the King, <hi>vide Salm. de Ufuris.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58267:75"/>For theſe if they can ſcrew money out of any, let them live; but we take away the lives of the Innocent, and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney too.

I believe they think they have Friends in all Places; yet if thoſe of the Chiefeſt Quality were faithful to us, they would not dare to ſet a foot upon</hi> Athenian <hi>Ground.

I am alſo an eternal Enemy to thoſe who are of a Belief that the Ariſtocracy can't be well ſetled, unleſs the Government be reduced under the Tyranny of a few. I concluded formerly that the other Model was the beſt, becauſe there were thoſe that would have ventured Life and Limb in defence of it: I am ſtill</hi> (and unconſtant as he calls me) <hi>of the ſame Opinion.

And though I know the Altar can't protect me, yet I'll declare the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of theſe men to the World, and their Impiety to Heaven. I wonder that you being men of Probity, won't defend the Common Cauſe, when you know 'tis as eaſie a matter to ſtrike out any of your Names, as it is mine.</hi> Upon this the Thirty men's Cryer commanded the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men to ſieze <hi>Theramenes,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Officers headed by <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> an importunate, and brazen faced Fellow: <hi>Critias</hi> ſaid to them, we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up this man <hi>Theramenes</hi> condemned according to Law.

Shall I not ſuffer then (replied he) if I hold my Tongue? At length being compelled to die by drinking Juice of Hemlock, he, as the report goes, daſht the reſt on the Ground, adding, Here's an Health to honeſt <hi>Critias.</hi> And though I know theſe ſayings of his are not worth relating, yet this deſerves admiration, that he at the very point of death, neither loſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prudence, nor Facetiouſneſs.

There were ſlain of the Heavy-armed men above an hundred and twenty; of the Horſe <hi>Nicostratus</hi> ſurnamed the Fair, and two whom they ſurpriſed in their Beds. In their return they erected a Trophy, and getting all the Arms, and Baggage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they retired with their Booty to <hi>Phyla.</hi> The Horſe came out of <hi>Athens</hi> to their relief; But not one of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appearing, they ſtaid till the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſlain had taken them up, and then returned to the City again. From this time, the Thirty not thinking their Government ſecure, deſigned to ſeize upon <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> that it might ſerve them for a Place of Retreat, if occaſion were. Hereupon <hi>Critias,</hi> and the Thirty marcht into <hi>Eleuſis;</hi> where the Horſe muſtered the Citizens (pretending they would know how many they were, and how ſtrong a Garriſon, the Place would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) and ordered a Liſt of their Names to be taken.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58267:83"/>and marcht in the Highway that leads to the <hi>Piraeus.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Phyla</hi> hindred them at firſt from advancing, but the Place appearing to be of a large Circuit, and to require a great Gariſon, whereas they as yet were but a ſmall Party, they retired in a cloſe Body to the <hi>Munichia:</hi> then thoſe of the City went into the Horſe-Market marſhalling their men, ſo as to cover the way that leads to the Temple of <hi>Diana Munichia,</hi> and the <hi>Bendideum,</hi> being no leſs than fifty Deep, and in this Order they advanced.

                  </note> and made this Speech. <hi>I will partly inform you</hi> (Dear Countreymen) <hi>and partly remind you, that the Enemy which charge us in the right are thoſe that you routed five days agone; and that they in the Rear of the left are the Thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants that have unjuſtly baniſht us, turned
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58267:83"/>us out of our Habitations, and proſcribed our deareſt Friends. Now they are come into this Place, which we always wiſhed, and they themſelves ne'r expected. Here we face them with our Swords in our hands: the Gods alſo appear openly in our Defence, becauſe we were taken from our Tables, from out of our Beds, and from off the Market-place; ſome of us had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Offence, and others that were abroad, were baniſht. The Gods when it ſerved our advantage, declared themſelves for us, and ſent on a ſuddain a Storm in Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weather; and by their aſſiſtance though the Enemy were a Multitude, and we but an handful, yet we fought them, and erected a Trophy. Now their Providence has brought us into a Place, where the Enemy are obliged to march up Hill, ſo that they cannot ſhoot, nor dart their Javelins over their formoſt Ranks. On the contrary we can reach them with our Pikes, our Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and Stones, that we throw down the Hill, and wound a great many of them; though it was believed that we, eſpecially our firſt Rank, muſt have engaged them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even Ground. Now therefore if you, as becomes your ſelves, will couragiouſly dart your Javelins, you cannot miſs, for the Road is covered with them; and if they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58267:84"/>ſtand upon their Guard, they muſt always skulk under their Shields, ſo that we as it were engaging with Blindmen, ſhall at our pleaſure wound them, fly upon them, and rout them. But</hi> (Dear Countreymen and Fellow-Soldiers) <hi>every man of you muſt acquit himſelf, as if he were ſenſible that he alone ſhould be the cauſe of the Victory. A Victory, that</hi> (by the favour of Heaven) <hi>ſhall reſtore our Countrey, Habitations, Liberty, Preferments, Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to thoſe that have them. Happy are thoſe amongſt us that ſhall live to ſee this Victory, to behold the moſt joyful day that ever was. Happy! the man that falls, for none how wealthy ſoever can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo glorious a Monument. As ſoon as it is time. I'll begin the</hi> Paean, <hi>and when we invoke</hi> Mars, <hi>let us go with a joynt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to revenge on our Enemies the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies we have ſuffered from them.</hi> Having ended his Speech he faced about to the Enemy, but moved not forward, becauſe the Prieſt had charged them not to fall on, before one of their men were either killed or wounded. When this happens, I'll lead you on <hi>(ſaid the Prieſt)</hi> and you ſhall obtain the Victory, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhall be ſlain. Nor was he miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for as ſoon as the Army had taken
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58267:84"/>up their Shields, he as it were hurried on by a certain fatality, flew out one of the formoſt; where charging the Enemy he was killed, and afterwards buried by the Ferry over the <hi>Cephiſſus.</hi> The reſt got the Victory, and purſued the Enemy down the Hill to the plain Ground. There were ſlain of the Thirty <hi>Critias</hi> and <hi>Hippomachus,</hi> of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the <hi>Piraeus Charmides</hi> the Son of <hi>Glauco,</hi> and about ſeventy others. They ſtirpped none of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but took away their Arms only, and aftewards reſtored their Bodies upon truce.

Next Day the Thirty appeared much dejected, and ſat alone in Council; the three thouſand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo whereſoever they were poſted fell at variance.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58267:86"/>meeting with the Forragers of the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> did their Battalion ſome miſchief.

               <p>There was at that time an Ingenier in <hi>Athens</hi> (if this be worth relating) who apprehending that the Enemy were bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Engines to the Courſe, by the way that leads from the <hi>Lyceum,</hi> ordered huge Stones of a Load weight to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Draughts, and thrown down in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places in the Courſe,<note place="margin">Where they run races.</note> which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and each Stone created the Enemy a great deal of Trouble.

               <p>

When the Mercenary <hi>Greeks</hi> attackt the Places, ſhe her ſelf beheld them from her Chariot, and whoever deſerved her Commendation, ſhe liberally rewarded: whereby ſhe made her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries very brave men. She alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> in his Expeditions againſt the <hi>Myſians,</hi> and <hi>Piſidians;</hi> who at that time infeſted the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Territories. Inſomuch that <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> had a great Veneration for her, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times admitted her to his Councils. But when ſhe was ſomewhat paſt forty years of Age, <hi>Midias,</hi> her Daughter's Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, being egged on by the Speeches of ſome, who ſuggeſted to him that 'twas a diſhonour for him to lead a private life, and live under the Domination of a Woman; obſerving that ſhe had a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye upon others, as Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates commonly have; but repoſed confidence in him, and treated him with that familiarity that a Mother does her Son in Law, went into her Chamber (as 'tis reported) and ſtrangled her. He killed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58267:94"/>alſo her Son about ſeventeen years Old, a very comely Perſonage.</p>
               <p>When he had perpetrated this Villany, he ſiezed upon <hi>Scepſis</hi> and <hi>Gergis,</hi> two ſtrong Towns, where the greateſt part of <hi>Mania</hi>'s Treaſure was. The Gariſons in the other Towns would not receive him, but kept the Places for <hi>Pharnabazus.</hi> Soon after <hi>Midias</hi> requeſting that he might have the Province on the ſame Conditions <hi>Mania</hi> enjoyed it. <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi> returned him this Anſwer, that he ſhould keep his Preſents till he came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to fetch them, and him too. Adding, he wiſht not to live, without revenging <hi>Mania</hi>'s Death.</p>
               <p>In this Juncture comes <hi>Dercyllidas,</hi> and forthwith in the ſame day <hi>Lariſſa, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axitus,</hi> and <hi>Colonae</hi> Maritine Towns, ſurrendred themſelves to him. He ſent Meſſengers alſo to the <hi>Aeolian</hi> Cities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to reſume their Liberty, to receive him within their Walls, and to make an Alliance. The <hi>Neandrians, Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Cocylites</hi> complied with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Gariſons in them had misbehaved themſelves after <hi>Mania</hi>'s Death. But the Governour of <hi>Cebren</hi> a very ſtrong Place, hoping <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus,</hi> if he defended it, would prefer
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58267:94"/>him, did not receive <hi>Dercyllidas.</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged hereat, prepared to aſſault the Place; but being unſucceſsful in the firſt days Sacrifice, he repeated it the following, and when he had no better Succeſs in that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſacrificed again the third, and ſo continued on to the fourth; being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled, becauſe he haſtned to make himſelf Maſter of all the <hi>Aeolis,</hi> before <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> could arrive with Supplies. <hi>Athenadus</hi> a certain <hi>Sicyonian</hi> Captain, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> trifled away his time, and that he himſelf was able to cut off the <hi>Cebrenians</hi> Water, fell on with his own Company, and attempted to ſtop up a Fountain; but they of the Town, ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, wounded him, killed two, threw their Darts, and Javelins, and repulſed them.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> was grieving there at, ſuppoſing the Soldiers would make their Attacks with leſs Vigor; there came ſome Heralds out of the Town from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> declaring they did not approve of their Governors Proceedings, and that they would rather ſerve the <hi>Greeks</hi> than the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring about theſe things, one came from the Governour to acquaint them, that he would confirm what the firſt propoſed.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58267:95"/>Thereupon <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> after he had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully ſacrificed, ordered his men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the ſame day to their Arms, and marcht up to the Gates, the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſet them open, and received him; where he placed a Gariſon, and went directly to <hi>Scepſis,</hi> and <hi>Gergis. Midias</hi> being in continual apprehenſion of <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and fearing the Townſmen, ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Dercyllidas,</hi> that if he would give Hoſtages, he would come to a Parly. <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> ſent him one out of each of the Confederate Cities, bidding him take as many as he pleaſed, and whom he would: he took ten of them, and went out to parly.</p>
               <p>When he came to diſcourſe <hi>Dercyllidas,</hi> he askt him upon what Terms he might make an Alliance. He told him on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he reſtored the Citizens their Liberty, and permitted them to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their own Laws. When he had given him this Anſwer, he marcht on towards <hi>Scepſis. Midias</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it was not poſſible for him by force to prevent his Deſign without the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens Conſent, permitted him to enter the Town. <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> having ſacrificed to <hi>Minerva</hi> in the Citadel of <hi>Scepſis,</hi> thruſt out <hi>Midias</hi>'s Garriſon, and delivered up
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58267:95"/>the Town to the Citizens, exhorting them to live under ſuch a Government as became <hi>Greeks,</hi> and Freemen. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he left the Town, and ſet forward towards <hi>Gergis,</hi> ſeveral of the <hi>Scepſians</hi> attended him out of Honour, and Reſpect for the Service he had done them. <hi>Midias</hi> alſo following in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, deſired that <hi>Gergis</hi> might be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Poſſeſſion: <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> told him that he ſhould have Juſtice done him; and having ſaid ſo, marcht up to the Gates with <hi>Midias,</hi> the Army following two in Rank in a peaceable manner.</p>
               <p>The Gariſon diſcovering <hi>Midias</hi> in his Company from the lofty Turrets, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore darting. But <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> ſaying to <hi>Midias,</hi> command the Gates to be opened, and conduct me to the Temple, that I may ſacrifice there to <hi>Minerva. Midias</hi> was very loath to cauſe the Gates to be opened, but yielded to it at laſt, fearing he ſhould be inſtantly ſiezed. As ſoon as he entred the Town in company of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> he went to the Citadel, and having poſted his Soldiers upon the Walls, he with the reſt ſacrificed to <hi>Minerva.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sacrifice he commanded <hi>Midias</hi>'s Guards to ſtand to their Arms, in the Front of his Army, for being <hi>Midias</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:58267:96"/>was not any longer in danger, they ſhould now ſerve under him: Whereupon <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> not knowing how to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaid to <hi>Dercyllidas;</hi> I am going to make ſome reception for you.

               <p>When they were ſat, <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him after this manner. <hi>Midias</hi> (ſaid he) did your Father leave you Heir of your Family? Yes, ſaid he. Then ſays <hi>Dercyllidas,</hi> what Manors, what Arable, what Paſture have you?

Then it is ours (ſaid he) ſince we have obtained the Victory, for <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> is our Enemy. Therefore
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58267:96"/>(ſaid he) let ſomebody ſhow us where <hi>Mania</hi>'s and <hi>Pharnabazus</hi>'s Treaſure is: upon that ſome conducted him to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s Houſe, which <hi>Midias</hi> had ſeized, and he himſelf followed thither: after he had entred the Houſe, he called for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and commanded his Officers to ſieze them; denouncing, that if they were taken ſtealing of <hi>Mania</hi>'s Goods, they ſhould be inſtantly put to death.</p>
               <p>After they had ſhown all, and he had taken a view of them, he locked and ſealed them up, appointing a Guard over them. At his going out he ſpoke to the Captains and Commanders, whom he found at the door, we (ſaid he) have procured very near a Years pay for eight thouſand men, and if we get any thing elſe, that alſo ſhall be yours. This he acquainted them with, knowing when they heard it, that they would be in much better Diſcipline, and more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of their Duty. When <hi>Midias</hi> askt him, ſaying, Where muſt I dwell? <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyllidas</hi> made anſwer, in <hi>Scepſis,</hi> where 'tis moſt fitting for you, it being your own Countrey, and Father's Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> having diſpatcht theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and taken nine Cities in eight days; conſulted, how he might not be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

Thereupon he ſent to him, and demanded whether he would have Peace or War. <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> confidering that <hi>Aeolis</hi> lay as a Bulwark againſt <hi>Phrygia,</hi> his own Province, accepted a Truce; and when it was concluded, <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> went to <hi>Bithynica Thracia,</hi> where he had his Winter Quarters, which <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> was not much concerned at, becauſe the <hi>Bithynians</hi> had ſeveral times made War upon him. Here <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> ravaged, and ſpoiled the Countrey with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and procured plenty of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when ſome Auxiliaries ſent by <hi>Seuthes,</hi> being about two hundred <hi>Odryſian</hi> Horſe, and three hundred Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getiers, arrived from the other ſide of the Water, they encamped, and fortified themſelves about twenty Furlongs from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and demanded of <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> a Guard of Heavy-armed men for their Camp; and going out to forage, took a great many Slaves, and much Spoil. Their Camp being now full of Priſoners, and the <hi>Bithynians</hi> having Intelligence how many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> went out, and what
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58267:97"/>number of them ſtaid behind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, aſſembled a ſtrong Body of their Forces together, both Targetiers, and Horſe, and about day fell upon their Heavy-armed men, being near two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. As they advanced they threw their Lances, and darted their Javelins; when the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſaw themſelves wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and killed, not being able to do any thing, for that they were ſhut up within a Rampart of a man's height, they broke it down, and ſallied out upon them. But the <hi>Bithynians</hi> being Targetiers, retreated wherever they were charged, and eaſily avoided the Heavy-armed <hi>Greeks;</hi> then they galled them on all ſides with their Darts, and laid in every effort ſeveral of them dead on the Ground. At laſt they were cooped up, as it were in a Pen, and cut all in pieces, except fifteen that eſcaped to the <hi>Greeks</hi> Camp, who as ſoon as they perceived the Enemie's Deſign, eſcaped immediately in the Skirmiſh, undiſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Bithynians.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Bithynians</hi> having performed this Action expeditiouſly, and killed ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Odryſian Thracians,</hi> that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tents, recovered all their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and departed. So that the <hi>Greeks</hi> having Intelligence, and coming with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58267:98"/>Succours, found nothing in the Camp but the naked Carkaſſes. The <hi>Odryſians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they returned, buried their dead, drinking good ſtore of Wine over them, and celebrated Horſe-races; and at laſt joyning the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, they haraſſed and burned <hi>Bithynia.</hi>

               <p>After they had aſſembled the Soldiers together, and ſpoke thus to them, the General of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Troops made Anſwer, <hi>We</hi> (My Lords) <hi>are the ſame men now, that we were laſt year, but our General is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58267:98"/>another ſort of a Perſon than the former was; from which you may eaſily apprehend the reaſon, why we don't offend now, as we did before.</hi> The Commiſſioners from home being received in the ſame Tent with <hi>Dercyllidas,</hi> one of <hi>Aracus</hi>'s Retinue, informed them, that they left the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the <hi>Cherſonites</hi> at <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> who reported that the <hi>Cherſoneſe</hi> could not be manured, for that they were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ſpoyled by the <hi>Thracians,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a <hi>Wall were</hi> built from Sea to Sea; and then they might not only have a large and fertile Countrey for themſelves, but for as many of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> as would, to plant.

So the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners departed, and <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> knowing he was continued in Command, ſent again to <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and demanded of him, whether he would have Peace as he had the former Winter, or War. <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus</hi> choſe Truce; ſo <hi>Dercyllidas</hi>

So the Wall that he began in the Spring, he finiſhed before Autumn, and incloſed within it eleven Cities, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ports, abundance of good arable Land, a great quantity of which was ſowed, as alſo large and rich Paſtures, ſtored with all ſorts of Cattel.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Lyſander</hi> ſaw all things went contrary to his deſires, and perceived how matters were, he would not ſuffer the People to run after him for the future, telling thoſe plainly that begged his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that if he ſhould appear in their cauſe, it would fare the worſe. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his diſgrace very ill, and going to the King, ſaid to him, <hi>Ageſilaus!</hi> Is it one of

               <p>Upon this <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was pleaſed to hearken to him, and ſent him to the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont,</hi> where finding that <hi>Spithridates</hi> a <hi>Perſian,</hi> was in diſgrace with <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus;</hi> he diſcourſed, and perſwaded him with his Children, and the Eſtate he had, together with two hundred Horſe, to come over to the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> So leaving the reſt behind at <hi>Cyzicus,</hi> he brought <hi>Spithridates</hi> and his Son to <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus;</hi> who when he underſtood it, was well pleaſed therewith, and preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him about <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> his Province and Government.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> elated with the Opinion of the Army, that was coming

Tiſſaphernes</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> wanted Cavalry, and partly becauſe <hi>Caria</hi> was impaſſable for Horſe, ſuppoſing alſo he was provoked by his Fraud, concluded for certain he would fall into <hi>Caria,</hi> the Place of his Reſidence. Whereupon he drew all his Foot thither, and marcht about with his Horſe into the Plains of <hi>Maeander,</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58267:109"/>he could trample the <hi>Greeks</hi> under foot with his Cavalry, before they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Countries, that were impaſſable for Horſe.

               <p>All this while his march was without any oppoſition, but when he came near <hi>Daſcyllium,</hi> the Vant-Curriers aſcended up an Hill to ſee if they could diſcover any thing before them; when by chance a like number of <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> his Horſe, ſent by him under the Command of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines</hi> and <hi>Bancaeus</hi> his Baſtard Brother marcht up the ſame Hill; and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another at four hundred foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from each other;<note place="margin">

                  </note> at firſt they halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Greeks</hi> were drawn up four deep like a <hi>Phalanx,</hi> the <hi>Barbarians</hi> not above twelve in Front, though a great many deep.

So the <hi>Greeks</hi> were routed, though when <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> came to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58267:110"/>relieve them with his Heavy-armed men, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> loſt one man, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The next day after the Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Horſe, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſacrificed to ſee whether he might advance farther up into their Countrey,<note place="margin">The Liver is dumpt together, and all of a maſs in diſeaſed Cattle, which was an ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing.</note> but the Liver want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lobes, upon ſight of which he turned back, and marched down to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt; and finding he could not maintain his Ground in the Champion Countrey, without he had a ſufficient Body of Horſe, he reſolved to make ſuch Proviſion, that he might not be obliged to he always upon the defenſive ſide. Therefore he ordered that the wealthieſt men in all the adjacent Cities ſhould keep Horſes, and declared whoever furniſht out Horſe and Arms with an approved man, ſhould be excuſed from ſerving himſelf, which was effected with that Expedition, as if one willingly went to ſearch out another to be knockt on the head for him.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Spring,<note place="margin">

Upon this, one might ſee all the Schools full of men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing, the Tilt-yards of Horſe-men running, the Darters and Archers train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which made <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where thoſe things were done, a Place worth the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the Market was full of Horſes and Arms expoſed to ſale; the Braſiers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, Smiths, Shomakers, and Painters, were all employed about making of Arms, ſo that the City ſeemed to be the Shop of War. This added courage to every one, when they ſaw <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers return from the Schools with their Garlands, and dedicate them to <hi>Minerva.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> thinking the Contempt of an Enemy would beget a reſolution to fight, commanded the Cryers to bring out thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> naked to ſale, that were taken by the Foragers; the Soldiers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them have white skins, becauſe they ſeldom expoſed their Bodies naked, being effeminate, and tender, and always coacht about; thought a War with ſuch People would be no more than if they were to fight with a Company of Women. At this time, a year being almoſt elapſed ſince
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58267:111"/>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> firſt began his expedition: The XXX.

               <p>
                  <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> thinking he ſpread this report, deſigning to deceive him again, and that now he would in good earneſt fall into <hi>Caria,</hi> paſſed with his Foot thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he had done before, and poſted his Horſe in the Plains of <hi>Meander. Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> did not deceive him, and according as he had given out, he fell into the Neighbourhood of <hi>Sardes,</hi> and marching three day through the deſerted Countrey of the Enemies, got ſtore of Proviſions for his Army. The fourth day the Enemies Horſe appearing, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> commanded the Camp-Maſter General to paſs the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctolus,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:58267:111"/>and mark out a Camp. Then the <hi>Perſians</hi> obſerving ſome of the <hi>Greeks</hi> that followed the Camp to ſtragle for pillage, killed ſeveral of them. Which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> perceiving, commanded the Horſe to go, and relieve them, but the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeeing Succours come, drew up in a cloſe Body, and faced them with all their Troops. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> underſtanding that the Enemies Foot were not yet come up, thought it was a fit opportunity to fight if he could; thereupon he ſacrificed, and forthwith leading his <hi>Phalanx</hi> againſt the Enemies Horſe that confronted him, he commanded out all thoſe that were ten years paſt man's Eſtate, to charge with full ſpeed, the Targetiers to follow on running, after which he commanded the Horſe to fall on, making as if he would ſecond them with the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> received this Commiſſion, he in the firſt place ordered the Iſlands, and Maritine Towns to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quip as many Gallies as they thought fit.

When the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>invited us to joyn with them in the attempt againſt the</hi> Pireus, <hi>the whole Community ordered, that no aſſiſtance ſhould be given them.

Ben't concerned at the Multitudes of their People, but rather be the more couragious, conſidering that when you your ſelves had a larger Dominion, your Enemies were the moſt numerous; who concealed their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred as long as they wanted an opportunity to revolt. But when the</hi> Lacedemonians

                  <hi>got the upper hand, they declared their Sentiments concerning you; and now if both of us bend our Forces againſt them, you may be aſſured that ſeveral other States will diſcover themſelves. And you will find my Words to be true, if you pleaſe to conſider well on't. For who is there left that favors them? not the</hi> Argives, <hi>for they have always been their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

And when they had accompliſht their Deſigns, what Power, what Honors, or what Riches did they impart to them?

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58267:115"/>in every Place a Tyranny. The King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>who contributed ſo much to their Conqueſt of us fares no better, than if he had aſſiſted us againſt them. If you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will head thoſe that have been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly oppreſſed, you will in probability be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more powerful than ever: When ye commanded, ye were only Generals at Sea, but now ye are Leaders of us, and the</hi> Peloponeſians, <hi>with thoſe you had formerly, as alſo the King himſelf that has ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Power. You your ſelves are ſenſible that we did the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and we in probability ſhall now follow you more vigorouſly, than we did them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. For we come not to ſerve the</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, Syracuſians, <hi>or others, as we did before, but to revenge our own Injuries. Neither are you ignorant, that this their exorbitant Power can be with leſs difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ruined, than that Dominion of yours. You with your Fleet forced Obedience from your Subjects, but they though few, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over thoſe that are Superiour to them in number, and as well appointed as themſelves. This</hi> (My Lords of <hi>Athens</hi>) <hi>we have to add, that you are ſenſible we invite you to Advantages of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to your Country, than to our own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Oration was ended, ſeveral
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58267:116"/>of the <hi>Athenians</hi> approved of it, and 'twas reſolved by all, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> ſhould be ſuccoured. <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put it to the Vote, and declared, That though the <hi>Piroeus</hi> was unwalled, yet they would at their own peril, make them a return greater than the kindneſs they had received. We therefore (ſaid he) will aſſiſt you againſt them in caſe they attack you, becauſe ye did not joyn with them againſt us. The <hi>Thebans</hi> returned home, and prepared to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Poſture of Defence, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> made preparations to ſuccor them. Nor were the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand with them; for <hi>Pauſanias</hi> their King came down upon <hi>Boeotia</hi> with an Army of <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Pelopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians,</hi> but the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not joyn them. <hi>Lyſander</hi> having the Command of the Forces from <hi>Phocis, Orchomenus,</hi> and the Adjacent Places, arrived at <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artus</hi> before <hi>Pauſanias;</hi> where as ſoon as he came, he lay not ſtill in expectation of the Army from <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with thoſe Troops he had to the Walls of <hi>Haliartus;</hi> perſwading them firſt to relinquiſh the Intereſt of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> and to reſume their Liberty. But the <hi>Thebans</hi> that were in the Gariſon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58267:116"/>his Deſigns: whereupon he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Town, which the other <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> came full ſpeed with their Horſe, and Heavy-armed men to relieve. But whether they ſurprized <hi>Lyſander,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had Intelligence of their march, and expected them in hopes of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is uncertain; though this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the fight was under the Walls of <hi>Haliartus,</hi> and he erected a Trophy before the Gates thereof.<note place="margin">Lyſander <hi>ſlain.</hi>
                  </note> Afterwards <hi>Lyſander</hi> being killed, ſome of his men fled to an Hill, whom the <hi>Thebans</hi> eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, and aſcended up to the top of it, where being drawn into a narrow, and difficult paſs, the Heavy-amed men faced about; when two or three of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fell, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> rouled Stones down the Precipice upon the reſt, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with ſo great courage that the <hi>Thebans</hi> were beat from the Aſcent, and above two hundred of them ſlain.</p>
               <p>This Day the <hi>Thebans</hi> were dejected ſuppoſing their own loſs to be as great as that the Enemy had received. But the day after finding that the <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates had retreated homewards in the Night, they valued themſelves the more upon this Action. Yet when <hi>Pauſanias</hi> apppeared with his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58267:117"/>Army from <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> they thought themſelves in great danger again, and the report went that there was a profound Silence and Conſternation in their Camp. Next day when the <hi>Athenians</hi> came, and joyned them, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> could neither move with his Troops, nor fight; at which the <hi>Thebans</hi> were the more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Then <hi>Pauſanias</hi> calling his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and Captains together, conſulted whether he ſhould fight, or make truce to fetch off <hi>Lyſander,</hi> with the others that were killed. At length <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and the Commanders conſidering that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> was ſlain, his Army beaten and routed; that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had not joyned them; and that the Allies did them no Service: beſides that the Enemy was ſtrong in Horſe, and they but weak, the Bodies lay under the Walls, ſo that if they had been ſtronger, yet by reaſon of thoſe from the Turrets, it would be no eaſie matter to bring off the ſlain; they thought it beſt upon all theſe Reaſons, to make a Truce, and fetch them off. But the <hi>Thebans</hi> refuſed to deliver them on any Condition whatſoever, except it were, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſhould march out of their Countrey, who gladly accepted it, and taking their dead retired out of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58267:117"/>
                  <hi>Boeotia.</hi> After this Action, the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> went away much dejected, but the <hi>Thebans</hi> inſulting fell upon thoſe that ſtragled in the Villages, and purſued them to the Roads.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the Expedition of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians;</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias</hi> when he came home, was tried for his Life; being accuſed for coming later to <hi>Lyſander</hi> at <hi>Haliartus,</hi> than he ought to have done, having agreed to meet him by a certain day; and for that he had made Truce to fetch off the killed, and had not attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by fighting; as alſo for that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the <hi>Athenians</hi> taken in the <hi>Pirae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> beſides all this he did not make his Appearance, and therefore was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to loſe his Life. But he made his Eſcape to <hi>Tegea,</hi> where he ſickned, and died of a Diſtemper. And this was the State of Affairs in <hi>Greece</hi> at that time.</p>

               <p>AFterwards early in the Autumn <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> entring <hi>Phrygia,</hi> the Government of <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſtroyed the Countrey, taking in ſome Cities by Force, and others by Surrender. But <hi>Spithridates</hi> telling him, That, if he would go with him into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlagonia,</hi> he would bring him to an interview with the King thereof, and make him an Ally: <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was very forward to go, having a great deſire a long time before to bring over this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Obedience of the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> After <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> arrived in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlagonia, Cotys</hi> came to him, and made an Alliance; for though he was ſent for by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he went not too him, but by the perſwaſion of <hi>Spithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> left a thouſand Horſe, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Targetiers with <hi>Ageſilaus;</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning his thanks to <hi>Spithridates</hi> for them, ſaid, <hi>Tell me,</hi> Spithridates, <hi>won't you beſtow your Daughter on</hi> Cotys? <hi>That I would, replied he, more willingly a great deal than</hi> Cotys <hi>King of ſo large a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſo mighty a People, would
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58267:119"/>marry a poor Exiles Daughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much only was mentioned at that time about a Match; but afterwards <hi>Cotys</hi> being upon his departure came to take his leave of <hi>Ageſilaus;</hi> who orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Spithridates</hi> to withdraw, ſaid to <hi>Cotys</hi> in the preſence of the XXX Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; <hi>Pray tell me,</hi> Cotys, <hi>of what kind of Family is</hi> Spithridates <hi>deſcended? Of one,</hi> replied he, <hi>that is no ways inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any in</hi> Perſia. <hi>Have you ſeen,</hi> ſaid Ageſilaus, <hi>what an handſome Son he has? What then,</hi> ſays Cotys? <hi>Yes, I have, for laſt Night I ſupped with him. They ſay,</hi> replies Ageſilaus, <hi>that he has a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more beautiful than he. Before God,</hi> ſays Cotys, <hi>ſhe is a Beauty. Then,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Ageſilaus, <hi>Since you are become one of our Friends, by my conſent you ſhall marry her: for firſt ſhe is extraordinary hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the moſt welcome Quality in a Wife, and then deſcended of a moſt Illuſtrious Father, and one of ſo conſiderable Power, that being affronted by</hi> Pharnabazus, <hi>he has revenged himſelf, in the manner you ſee, and chaſed him out of his Province. You may be aſſured therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that as he is able to revenge himſelf on an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſo he can oblige a Friend; and conſider with your ſelf that if ſuch a thing ſhould
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58267:120"/>be, you will not only contract an Affinity with him, but with me alſo, and the reſt of the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>and we, as you well know, are the leading People of all</hi> Greece. <hi>What Nuptial Solemnity therefore can be more Pompous than yours? What Bride was ever attended by ſo many Horſe, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getiers, and Heavy-armed men, as ſhall conduct yours to your Court?</hi> Then <hi>Cotys</hi> asking him, ſaid, <hi>Ageſilaus! Does</hi> Spithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates <hi>approve of what you ſay? By Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> replied he, <hi>Cotys! I ſpeak not by his Order, for though the pleaſure of revenging my ſelf on an Enemy be very ſweet, yet I am much more pleaſed when I can find out any thing that can be ſerviceable to a Friend. Then,</hi> ſaid Cotys, <hi>why don't you ask his Conſent? Go you therefore</hi> Herip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas, <hi>and the reſt,</hi> ſays Ageſilaus, <hi>and inform him of theſe Propoſals, and uſe all the beſt Arguments you can to perſwade him;</hi> ſo they went and acquainted him: And whilſt they ſtaid, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall we,</hi> Cotys! <hi>ſend for</hi> Spithridates <hi>hither, for I believe he will be ſooner prevailed upon by you, than by all together?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſent for <hi>Spithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> and the reſt, and when they drew near, <hi>Herippidas</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ageſilaus! Not to trouble you with the whole Relation of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58267:120"/>Matter,</hi> Spithridates, ſays he, <hi>will ſubmit wholly to your pleaſure. Then 'tis my pleaſure,</hi> ſays Ageſilaus, <hi>that you</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates <hi>bestow your Daughter on</hi> Cotys, <hi>and that you</hi> Cotys <hi>accept her, and I wiſh you much joy. Yet we cannot ſend you her by Land before the Spring. Faith,</hi> ſaith Cotys, <hi>but you may preſently have her conveyed if you pleaſe by Sea.</hi> In Concluſion, the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Treaty being ratified, <hi>Cotys</hi> was diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Immediately <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> knowing him to be in haſt, fitted out a Gally, giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to <hi>Callias</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Lady; and went himſelf to <hi>Daſcyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> the Court of <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> which had a great many, and large Villages about it, furniſhed with all neceſſaries for life, as alſo Wild Beaſts, ſome in Parks, and others in Forreſts, exceeding delightful, being encompaſſed by a River ſtored with all ſorts of Fiſh, and abundance of Fowls for thoſe that loved the Game.</p>
               <p>There he took up his Winter Quarters, and partly in that Place, and partly by Depredations in the Countrey got Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his Army; but as the Soldiers never having been foyled before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Enemy, and were not upon their Guard when they foraged, <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi> with two Scythed Chariots, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58267:121"/>four hundred Horſe, met them ſtragling in the Plains. As ſoon as the <hi>Greeks</hi> diſcovered him advancing towards them, about ſeven hundred of them drew up in a Body. <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> without any more ado placed the Chariots in the Front, and following himſelf with the Horſe in the Rear, commanded them to drive upon the Enemy. The Chariots falling in, and breaking their Body, the Horſe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with killed and took Priſoners an hundred men; and the reſt fled to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who was not far off with the Heavy-armed men. Three or four days after <hi>Spithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> diſcovered <hi>Pharnabazus</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Caue,</hi> a large Village about an hundred and ſixty Furlongs from thence, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately informed <hi>Herippidas</hi> of it; who ever longing to perform ſome brave Exploit, deſired of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Heavy-armed men, as many Targe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, <hi>Spithridates</hi>'s Horſe, the <hi>Paphla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians,</hi> and what <hi>Greek</hi> Horſe he could prevail with beſides. When he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Promiſe of them, he ſacrificed, and having been ſucceſsful therein, in the Evening he left off, and commanded the Soldiers when they had ſupped, to make their appearance before the Camp. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow dark, and not half the number
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58267:121"/>of each Party came out; yet that he might not be laughed at by his Fellow Commiſſioners if he deſiſted, he went with the Forces he had, and attacking <hi>Pharnabazus</hi>'s Camp by break of day, he killed a great many of the Out-guards that were <hi>Myſians,</hi> and put the reſt to flight, taking the Camp, and in it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cups, together with <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>'s Furniture, as alſo a great deal of Baggage, and ſeveral Draught-Horſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> fearing if he ſtaid in any one Place, he ſhould be Empounded and beſieged, wandred up and down the Countrey like the <hi>Nomades,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">People of <hi>Scythia,</hi> who have no certain Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> carefully concealing his Encampments. Whilſt <hi>Spithridates</hi> and the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> were carrying off their Spoyl, <hi>Herippidas</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſet on the Commanders of the Heavy-armed men, and Captains to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive <hi>Spithridates,</hi> and the <hi>Paphlagoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of their ſhare, that ſo he might have the more Captives for the Slave-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. This Injury they reſented, and like men affronted, and diſgraced, depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Night with Bag and Baggage to <hi>Ariaeus</hi> at <hi>Sardes:</hi> confiding in him, for that he as well as they had revolted from the King, and made War againſt him. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Expedition affected <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:58267:122"/>more than that <hi>Spithridates, Megabyzus</hi> and the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> quitted the Service.</p>
               <p>There was one <hi>Apollophanes</hi> a <hi>Cyziceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who had been formerly a Gueſt to <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and being at that time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> informed him that he thought he could bring <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and him to an Enterview in order to treat of Peace. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> hearing this, gave <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophanes</hi> ſafe conduct; and he brought <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus</hi> to the Place appointed; where <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> and the XXX Commiſſioners were ſat down in the Graſs expecting <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus;</hi> who came thither in very rich Attire. And when the Servants were ſpreading Carpets for him, on which the effeminate <hi>Perſians</hi> ſoat themſelves: he ſeeing the mean Accommodation <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> had, was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to indulge himſelf, and ſat down on the Ground juſt as he was. As ſoon as they had ſaluted one another, <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> firſt reached out his right hand, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> did the ſame to him: When this was done, <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Elder,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>'s Speech.</note> began to ſpeak. Ageſilaus, <hi>and ye Gentlemen of</hi> Lacedemon <hi>that are preſent! I was your Friend and Ally, whilſt you made War againſt the</hi> Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>for I reinforced your Navy with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Money; on the Shore I fought on
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58267:122"/>Horſeback, and purſued the Enemy into the Sea. Neither could you ever charge me</hi> as you did Tiſſaphernes, <hi>with under-hand dealing either in Word or Deed; and though I have carried my ſelf thus to you, yet you have treated me in ſuch a manner, as not to leave me a Meals-meat in my own Province, unleſs like a Dog, I ſhould eat of your Scraps. Thoſe fair Buildings, and Parks planted with Trees, and ſtored with Dear, which my Father left me, and were my Divertiſement, are now all either burnt or destroyed by you. If I therefore know not what is Justice, and Equity, do you inform me, whether this be the way by which men who have a due ſence of Honour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Gratitude.</hi> The XXX Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners being very much aſhamed at this Speech, remained ſilent, and after ſome pauſe, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> began.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s Speech.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſuppoſe</hi> (Pharnabazus) <hi>you know that in the</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>Republicks, men contract Alliances of Hoſpitality one with another, and that when their reſpective Countries Quarrel, they declare themſelves Enemies, as well againſt the Perſons they entertain, as their Countries, and ſometimes happen to kill them too. Now we are neceſſitated, being we are at War with your King, to look upon every thing of his, as belonging to an
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58267:123"/>Enemy; though we deſire nothing more than to renew our Friendſhip with you. And indeed if your coming over to us would only make you change your Maſters, and take on you our Yoke inſtead of the King of</hi> Perſia<hi>'s, I ſhould not have given you this advice; but now by the Alliance with us you ſhall not be obliged to proſtrate your ſelf before any, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Superior, but live, and enjoy your own.</hi> For Liberty in my opinion is of equal value to all the Riches in the World; <hi>nor do I adviſe you, to purchaſe your freedom by the loſs of your Greatneſs, but by the advantage of our Alliance, to enlarge</hi> (not the Kings) <hi>but your own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, by ſabduing others in your own condition, and making them your own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Thus if you become both free and wealthy, what will you then want to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat your Happineſs. Pharnabazus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I will tell you plainly what I'll do; <hi>So you ought,</hi> ſaid Ageſilaus; <hi>If then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the King ſends another Governour, and commands me to obey him, I'll make an Alliance with you; but if he gives me the Supreme Command</hi> (for this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ſeems to be worthy ones Ambition) <hi>aſſure your ſelves I'll make a vigorous War upon you. Ageſilaus</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58267:123"/>this, took him by the hand, and ſaid to him: <hi>I wiſh</hi> (Gallant Prince) <hi>ſince you are a Perſon of ſo great Generoſity, that we might enjoy your Friendſhip; yet be ſatisfied in this one thing, that I will draw my Army out of your Province with all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and hereafter if the War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as long as there is any elſe to fall upon, we will forbear you and yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conference ending, <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> mounted, and rode away, but his Son by his Wife <hi>Parapita,</hi> an handſome Youth, ſtaying behind a while, ran to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>I contract an Alliance of Hoſpitality with you: I accept it,</hi> replies Ageſilaus: <hi>Remember it then, ſaid the Young man,</hi> and forthwith gave <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> a neat Dart that he had. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it, and pulling the curious Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings off of <hi>Idoeus</hi> the Painter's Horſe preſented the Youth with them; who after that nimbly mounted his Steed, and followed his Father.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58267:124"/>extraordinarily concerned, conſidering what Honours, and Hopes he ſhould thereby be deprived of. However he called the Confederates together, and communicated to them the State's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, declaring that he was neceſſitated to go to the aſſiſtance of his Countrey. If things ſucceed well with us, aſſure your ſelves, ſaid he, that I will not forget you, but return, and do whatever you ſhall require.

               <p>Afterwards when he had paſſed the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> there were choſen Umpires, of the <hi>Lacedemonians, Menaſcus, Herip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas,</hi> and <hi>Orſippus;</hi> of the Confederates one out of every City.

                     <hi>Timolaus</hi> his Speech.</note> Then ſaid <hi>Timolaus</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian: Gentlemen, Methinks the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>are like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which being not large near their Springs, may be eaſily forded over, but while they continue their courſe farther, the acceſſion of other Waters makes their Stream more rapid. Juſt ſo are the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, <hi>for at the Place they ſet forth they are only themſelves; but in their Progreſs, they having joyned other Cities, become more numerous, and are hardly to be grapled with. I find too,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that thoſe who would deſtroy Waſps, if they hunt them after they get out of their holes, are ſtung by Swarms of them; but if they ſet fire to them in their Neſts, then they deſtroy them, and ſuffer no harm at all themſelves. Therefore upon theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I think it beſt to give them battel at</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>or if that cannot be, yet as near to the Place as is poſſible.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal ſeeming reaſonable, they made a Decree accordingly; and whilſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated about the Command in Chief, they agreed how many they ſhould draw up in Front, leſt they ſhould make their Battalions too deep, and thereby let the Enemy encompaſs them. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:58267:126"/>together with the <hi>Tegeans,</hi> and <hi>Mantineans</hi> marched out by the Sea ſide, and arrived about the ſame time at <hi>Sicyon,</hi> that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates did at <hi>Nemea.</hi> Hereupon the latter made an Impreſſion upon the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> near <hi>Epiecaea;</hi> and at firſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Light-armed men darting, and throwing from an Eminence, did great Execution upon them; but the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> marching down by the Sea ſide, and taking the way through the Plain, deſtroyed, and burnt the Countrey. The Enemy went out and encamped by a Brook that ran before their Camp; &amp; the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> advancing within leſs than ten fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs off them, encamped alſo, and lay ſtill.</p>
               <p>I will now give an Account how ſtrong both Armies were: there were drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about ſix thouſand of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi> Heavy-armed men, of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Triphylians, Acrorians,</hi> and <hi>Laſioneans</hi> near 3000; of <hi>Sicyonians</hi> 1500, of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurians, Traezenians, Hermioneans</hi> and <hi>Halieans</hi> no leſs than 3000; beſides theſe there were ſix hundred <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Horſe, ſupported by three hundred <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Archers. Of the <hi>Marganean, Ledri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Amphidolian</hi> Slingers, no leſs than four hundred. The <hi>Phliaſians</hi> were not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58267:126"/>in the Army, but pretended there was a Truce. Theſe were the Forces of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> The Enemies Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſix thouſand <hi>Athenian</hi> Heavy-armed men, and as the report went, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand <hi>Argives.</hi> The <hi>Boeotians,</hi> the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> being not there, were but about 5000. the <hi>Corinthians</hi> three thouſand, and out of all <hi>Euboea</hi> three thouſand more. Theſe were their Heavy-armed men. The <hi>Boeotian</hi> Horſe, the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> being not there were about eight hundred, the <hi>Athenian</hi> near ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, of the <hi>Chalcideans</hi> that came out of <hi>Euboea</hi> an hundred, of the <hi>Locri Opuntij</hi> fifty. The Light-armed men together with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> exceeded this number, being joyned by the <hi>Locri Ozolae,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieans,</hi> and <hi>Acarnanians.</hi> Theſe were the Forces on both ſides.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Boeotians,</hi> whilſt they had the left Wing, were not urgent for a Battel, but when the <hi>Athenians</hi> were drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and they oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Achaeans</hi> in the right, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cried out, the Sacrifice was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious, and ordered to make ready for a Battle. Here at firſt they took no care to draw up ſixteen in Front, but made their Battalion altogether deep, nor did
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58267:127"/>they move to the right, that they might thereby outwing the Enemy. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> followed, that they might not be diſordered, although they underſtood that they were in danger of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. Hitherto the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did not diſcover that the Enemy advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe the Place thereabouts was woody; but after they had begun to ſing the <hi>Paean,</hi> they then perceived them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and commanded all to prepare for fighting, and being drawn up in the order, the Officers of the <hi>Mercenaries</hi> had marſhalled each Battalion; they were commanded to follow their Leader. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> advanced towards the right of the Enemy, and did ſo far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing them, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted ſix of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Regiments, and the <hi>Tegeans</hi> four.</p>
               <p>Now both Armies being leſs than a Furlong diſtant from each other, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> according to cuſtom ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Goat to <hi>Minerva Agrotera,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced toward the Enemy, wheeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſurround them with the part of their Wing that out-reached theirs. When the Battels were joyned, all the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> Confederates were foyled by the Enemy; except the <hi>Pellenians</hi> that fought
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58267:127"/>the <hi>Theſpieans,</hi> who behaved themſelves ſo well, that ſeveral were ſlain on both ſides. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> beat as many of the <hi>Athenians</hi> as fell to their ſhare, and ſurrounded them with their extended Wing, cutting off a great many, and marched on in good order, as if they had ſuffered nothing; and paſſed by four of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Regiments before they gave over the purſuit. Nor did they loſe any men except thoſe in the Charge againſt the <hi>Tegeans;</hi> but in their return they fell upon the <hi>Argives,</hi> and as the foremoſt Colonel was going to attack them, one, they ſay, cried out to let the foremoſt of the Enemy paſs, which being done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they galled their Flank, and killed a great many men that fled by them. After that, they received the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> coming back from purſuing, and cut in pieces abundance of them. Upon this the routed fled firſt to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, but afterwards by the Example of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> betook themſelves to their former Camp; thereupon the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> returned to the Place where the Battel begun, and erected a Trophy. This is the account of that Fight.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> haſtned with Succours out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and whilſt he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58267:128"/>was at <hi>Amphipolis; Dercyllidas</hi> brought him the News of a Victory the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> had obtained with the loſs of conſiderable numbers on the Enemies ſide, and but eight <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> though ſeveral of their Confederates were killed. Then <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Dercyllidas? would it not be convenient that the Cities which have ſent their Forces to joyn ours ſhould have Intelligence of it with all ſpeed? Dercyllidas</hi> made anſwer that they would be the more encouraged if they heard on't. Therefore <hi>ſince you are here,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ageſilaus, you might make a fit Meſſenger. Dercyllidas</hi> hearkned willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this, for he loved travelling, and ſaid to <hi>Ageſilaus, I'll go if you'll command me. Then I command you,</hi> replied he, <hi>and moreover I would have you tell them, that if things ſucceed well here, I'll be with them again according to my Promiſe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> was now departed from the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> marched through <hi>Macedon,</hi> and came into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> where the <hi>Lariſſeans, Cranonians, Scotuſaeans,</hi> and <hi>Pharſalians</hi> being in League with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> together with all the <hi>Theſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> except the Exiles, purſued him, and cut off ſome of his Rear. He marched with his Army in a Square, placing one half
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58267:128"/>of his Cavalry in the Front, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Rear, but the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking his Rear, and hindering his March, he ſent all the Horſe to the Front, except his own Guards. As ſoon as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted each other, the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> not thinking fit with their Horſe to engage the Heavy-armed men, faced about, and retreated gently: <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s Horſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them unadviſedly, and he finding both them and the Enemy in diſorder, ſent his own Guards, being very ſtout men, and ordered them to command the reſt to purſue with all ſpeed imaginable, and not give them opportunity of facing about. The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> coming upon them contrary to their expectation, ſome of them fled, ſome turned upon the Enemy, and others that attempted the like were flanked by the Horſe, and taken. <hi>Polymachus</hi> the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> that commanded the Horſe faced about, and fighting with thoſe he had with him, was ſlain. Thereupon the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> falling into a confuſed Flight, ſome were killed, and others taken, nor did they make an halt, till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Mountain <hi>Narthacium.</hi> Then <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> erected a Trophy between <hi>Pras</hi> and <hi>Narthacium,</hi> and reſted there, being
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58267:129"/>much pleaſed with the Action, in that he had beat thoſe Cavalry that gloried in their Horſemanſhip, with ſuch Horſe as he himſelf had raiſed.</p>
               <p>Next day paſſing the <hi>Achaean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Pthia</hi> he marched through a Friends Countrey, till he came to the frontiers of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and as he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Enemies Countrey, the Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like a Creſcent; News came too that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were beaten at Sea, and that their Admiral <hi>Piſander</hi> was killed. There was a Relation of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement how it was; that both the Fleets engaged about <hi>Cnidus,</hi> that <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus</hi> the Admiral was there with the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> and <hi>Conon</hi> with the <hi>Grecian</hi> Navy lay in the Front; and that when <hi>Piſander</hi> had drawn up againſt <hi>Conon,</hi> it appeared he had fewer Ships in his whole Navy, than he only in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fleet. The Confederates that were in the Rear ran immediately; but <hi>Piſander</hi> engaging the Enemy with a ſtemmed Gally, was forced aground, and the reſt that were driven aſhore left their Ships, getting as well as they could into <hi>Cnidus,</hi> only <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> fought on board his own Ship, till he was ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was exceedingly troubled at
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58267:129"/>firſt when he heard it, yet recollecting that as the News of good Succeſs is a marvellous encouragement to an Army; ſo if things fall out ill, it is not neceſſary to let them know it; he ſoon after chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Mind, and reported to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers how <hi>Piſander</hi> was killed, but had got the Victory; and after he had related it, he offered ſome Bullocks for the good News, and ſent part of the Sacrifice to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons. So that a light skirmiſh happening, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s men beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, upon the Fame of this Sea-Victory that he gave out the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had won.</p>
               <p>There were oppoſed to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> the <hi>Boeotians, Athenians, Argives, Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Aenians, Euboeans,</hi> and both the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri: Ageſilaus</hi> had with him a Regiment of <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that came from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and half of another from <hi>Orchomenus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſide theſe the Half Slaves from <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and the <hi>Mercenaries</hi> that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rippidas</hi> commanded; as alſo thoſe that he joyned in his march from the <hi>Greek</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> there he was joyned by the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> and <hi>Phocean</hi> Heavy-armed men. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Targetiers, but the Horſe were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and theſe were the Forces of both Armies.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:58267:130"/>
               <p>I will give a Relation of the Fight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an one as has not happened in our time.<note place="margin">The Battel at <hi>Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi>
                  </note> The Armies met on the Plains near <hi>Coronea, Ageſilaus</hi>'s Forces marching from the <hi>Cephiſus,</hi> and the <hi>Thebans</hi> from <hi>Helicon. Ageſilaus</hi> led the Van himſelf, the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> being in the Rear of all: the <hi>Thebans</hi> had the Van of their Army, and the <hi>Argives</hi> the Rear. Juſt as they engaged there was a profound Silence in both Armies, and when they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Furlongs diſtance, the <hi>Thebans</hi> ſet up a ſhout, and gave a furious charge, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the diſtance of three hundred feet, the Mercenaries of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion that <hi>Herippidas</hi> commanded, ran upon the Enemy; and together with them the <hi>Ionians, Aeolians,</hi> and <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpontians;</hi> theſe were all thoſe that ran together, and by that time they came within a Pikes length, they routed thoſe that confronted them. Nor did the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives</hi> ſtand <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s men, but fled to <hi>Helicon:</hi> here when ſome of the Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries were already ſetting a Garland up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s head, advice came that the <hi>Thebans</hi> had beaten the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> and made their way to the Baggage: thereupon he moved with his Battalion, and marched towards them. The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:58267:130"/>ſeeing their Companions fled, and deſirous to make their eſcape to them, got together in a Body, and retired with diligence.</p>
               <p>Now without all Controverſie we may allow <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to be a man of great courage, though here he took not the ſafeſt courſe; for he might have let thoſe that retreated, have paſſed him, and in the purſuit have cut off their Rear; though he did not ſo, but faced the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and fell upon their Front. So they engaged, and claſhing their Bucklers together, fought, ſlew, and were ſlain; at laſt ſome of the <hi>Thebans</hi> eſcaped to <hi>Helicon,</hi> and ſeveral in their Retreat were killed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Victory, was brought wounded to his Battalion, ſome of the Horſe went and told him that there were about eighty of the Enemy, with their Arms in the Temple of <hi>Minerva Itonia,</hi> and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſhould be done with them. He, though he had received ſeveral Wounds, did not forget the Priviledges of Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but commanded to let them go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would, and ſuffered none to injure them. Then (becauſe it was late) they ſupped, and repoſed themſelves, and in the Morning he commanded <hi>Gylis</hi> a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58267:131"/>Colonel to draw up the Army, to erect a Trophy to crown all with Garlands in Honour of the Goddeſs; the Pipers were alſo ordered to play, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. The <hi>Thebans</hi> ſent Heralds to deſire a Truce that they might fetch off their ſlain, which was granted. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> went to offer the tenth of the Spoil to <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18750 <hi>lib.</hi>
                  </note> which was not leſs than an hundred Talents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gylis</hi> the Colonel marcht with the Army into <hi>Phocis,</hi> and there fell into <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris;</hi> the day after the Soldiers plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Villages, and took away both Goods, and Proviſions, but towards the Evening as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> retreated, the <hi>Locri</hi> purſued and galled them with their Lances and Javelins. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> facing about and following them, killed ſome, and after that they fell no more upon their Rear, but ſhot at them from the Eminencies. The <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> tried to drive them through the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, but as it grew dark, they by the reaſon of the difficult Paſs, were killed in their Retreat, ſome becauſe they could not ſee before them, and others periſhed by the Shot.

                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> returned to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> by Sea: At the ſame time the War was carried on by the Confederates who made Excurſions from <hi>Corinth,</hi>

The <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſeeing their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey deſtroyed, their Subjects conſumed by the War, and expoſed to the Violence of the Enemy, when the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates were free from Depredations and enjoyed their own Eſtates; the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, eſpecially the Principal men deſiring Peace conferred together, and diſpoſed one another thereto. But when thoſe of the Confederates, who had received mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the King, and were the greateſt Promoters of the War, conſidered, that the City would go near to take part with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> if they took not off thoſe who were inclined to Peace, they reſolved upon a Maſſacre. And at the firſt they engaged in a moſt horrid and bloody Deſign; for whereas none though
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58267:132"/>condemned to die, are executed in the Feaſt <hi>Euclea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">There was a Temple in honour of <hi>Diana Euclea</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and another in <hi>Attica,</hi> and I ſuppoſe the Feaſt here might be called from thence, <hi>vide Pauſ.</hi>

               <p>As ſoon as the Deſign was known, ſome of the Principal men fled immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Images in the Market-place, and others to the Altars, but both the Murderers, and thoſe who ſet them on being eminently wicked, and void of all ſenſe of humanity, butchered them in the Holy Places: Inſomuch that ſome good men, who were not to be maſſacred, were exceedingly afflicted to behold ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Villainies. Several of the Old men being at that time in the Market-place were killed; but the Young men (<hi>Paſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melus</hi> having ſome ſuſpicion of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Artillery Ground) till the Cry was heard, when ſome eſcaping the Slaughter came thither, and running from thence into the Tower, they repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Argives</hi> with the reſt that attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>

               <p>Whilſt they were conſulting what to do, the Capital of a Pillar fell down, though there was neither Earthquake, nor Wind ſtirring, and when they ſacrificed the Entrails were ſuch, that the Prieſts ſignified, it would be their ſafeſt way to depart out of the Place. So they at firſt like men going into Exile forſook their Countrey <hi>Corinth;</hi> but when their Friends, Relations, and ſome of the Magiſtrates came to them, entreating, and promiſing them upon their Oaths that they ſhould live at home in ſecurity, ſeveral returned back again. Yet when they ſaw them play the Tyrants, and that their Country was ruined, being called <hi>Argos</hi> inſtead of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> their Boundaries pulled down, and themſelves forced to be made Denizons of the former, which they had no occaſion to be, and of leſs Power in their own Countrey, than Foreigners: Some of them thinking this kind of Life not to be born, endeavoured to reduce <hi>Corinth</hi> to ſuch a condition as it had been formerly in, and by reſtoring it to its Liberty, and wholeſome Laws, to purge it from Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; which if they were able to effect, they ſhould be called the Saviours of it, and if they could not, yet they having aimed at the nobleſt and greateſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns

               <p>Whereupon two men only <hi>Paſimelus</hi> and <hi>Alcimenes</hi> attempted it, and paſſed a Brook to meet <hi>Praxitas</hi> a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Colonel, who at that time was with his Regiment in Gariſon at <hi>Sicyon:</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him that they could let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town the way that leads to the <hi>Lechaeum.

The two men <hi>Paſimelus</hi> and <hi>Alcimenes</hi> ſhewed them all things ſo much to the their ſatisfaction, that he which went in with them reported that every thing was without fraud according to the account the men had given. Soon after <hi>Praxitas</hi> entred the City, and when he ſaw his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after they were drawn up, to be weak
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58267:133"/>by reaſon of the diſtance of the Walls one from another, the Soldiers made a <hi>Paliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and a Trench, ſuch an one as they could, till their Confederates came with Succours, for they had behind them in the Porta Gariſon of <hi>Boeotians.</hi> The next day after the Night that they entred the City, there was no Skirmiſh; the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Argives</hi> coming with their whole Power againſt them, found the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in the right, the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> and an hundred and fifty <hi>Corinthian</hi> Exiles next them. The Enemy confronted them at the Eaſtern Part of the Wall, next to which were <hi>Philocrates</hi> and his Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, juſt by them the <hi>Argives,</hi> and the Townſmen of <hi>Corinth</hi> in the left. The <hi>Argives</hi> being confident of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers charged the Enemy, and beat the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonians,</hi> ruined their <hi>Paliſado,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them to the Sea, where they killed ſeveral of them. <hi>Paſimachus</hi> Colonel of the Horſe, though he had but a ſmall Party, when he ſaw the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> hard preſt; yet he commanded his men to tie their Horſes to the Trees, and take <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonian</hi> Bucklers, and afterwards getting a Body of men together, fell upon the <hi>Argives.</hi>

The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Exiles beat thoſe that they engaged with, and gained the upper Ground, whereupon they advanced to the Wall of the Town. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being poſſeſſed of the <hi>Paliſado</hi> on the left, when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> were beaten, came out to their Relief. But when the <hi>Argives</hi> ſaw them in the Rear, they turned their backs, and fled confuſedly out of their Works; and thoſe likewiſe in the Rear of the right were flanked, and cut in pieces by them; but they who were by the Wall, run back to the Town in great diſorder, yet meeting with the Exiles, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to be Enemies, they gave back again, where ſome mounting the Walls leaped down and periſhed, others being cloſe purſued to the Ladders were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and killed.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58267:134"/>that time Providence put ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into their hands as they themſelves durst not have prayed for. For who would not eſteem it Providence that an handful of men ſhould deſtroy a Multitude, being ſtruck with a Panick fear, amazed, expoſed, none of them offering to turn again, and all contributing ſomething or other to their own deſtruction?</hi> In a little compaſs of time a great many were ſlain, ſo that as uſually one ſees heaps of Corn, Wood, or Stones, here you might ſee heaps of Carkaſſes. Some of the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were killed in the Port, others upon the Walls, and ſome upon the covering of the Docks.</p>
               <p>Soon after the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Argives</hi> made a Truce, and fetcht off their ſlain. When the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Confederates came with Succors, <hi>Praxitas</hi> got his men together, and reſolved to throw down the Wall, that the Army might enter at the Breach, and marching with his Forces the way that leads to <hi>Megara,</hi> he attacked <hi>Sidus,</hi> and took that and <hi>Crommyo,</hi> in which Towns he left Gariſons, and in his Return fortified <hi>Epiecaea,</hi> becauſe, it being near an Allie's Countrey, might ſerve the Confederates for a Place of Defence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he disbanded the Army, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58267:135"/>went to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> From this time no conſiderable Expeditions were underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, only the Cities ſent recruits to <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Sicyon</hi> to defend thoſe Places; but both ſides having a great many Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they carried on the War very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with theſe.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time <hi>Iphicrates</hi> going to make an attempt upon <hi>Phlius,</hi> with his ſmall Forces made Excurſions, but thoſe of the Town being not careful to relieve their men, he killed ſo many of them, that the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> who before would not receive the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> into their City, fearing they would reſtore thoſe Exiles that pretended to be baniſhed for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to their Intereſt, were now ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe <hi>Athenians</hi> who were at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> that they ſent to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and put the Town and Citadel under their Protection. However though the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had a regard to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles, yet they made no mention of recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them home, as long as they were poſſeſt of <hi>Phlius.</hi> But quitted the Place as ſoon as the People began to come to themſelves, and reſtored them their Laws, and Government in the ſame condition they found them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iphicrates</hi> Soldiers making frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58267:135"/>into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> haraſſed it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked their fortified Places, for the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> heavy-armed men durſt never look them in the face without their walls; ſuch a terror were theſe Targetiers to them. And theſe Targetiers did ſo dread the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Heavy-armed men that they would not come within reach of their Lances. For once the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took and killed ſeveral of them in a Purſuit; and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> who before deſpiſed thoſe Targetiers, did now much more contemn their own Confederates, becauſe once when the <hi>Mantineans</hi> came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their own men, and attacked the Targetiers, the latter threw their Javelins at them from off the Wall that reaches towards <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> and making them give back, purſued, and ſlew ſeveral of them. So that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> jeared their Confederates for being as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Targetiers, as Children are of Bugbears. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Exiles marching out of the <hi>Lechaeum</hi> inveſted the City of <hi>Corinth.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Athenians</hi> dreading the Power of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and fearing they would come upon them with their whole Forces by the Long-walls which <hi>Praxitas</hi> had demoliſhed, thought
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58267:136"/>it neceſſary to rebuild part of them. In order thereto they came with abundance of Maſons and Carpenters, and within a few days time completely rebuilt that part of the Wall which looked towards <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and the Weſt, but that toward the Eaſt they finiſhed more at leiſure.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> obſerving that the <hi>Argives</hi> lived at home in Plenty,<note place="margin">Demoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Archon.</note> and were mightily taken with the War, undertook an Expedition againſt them. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> led the Army, who burnt their Countrey, and paſſing directly from thence to <hi>Corinth</hi> by the way of <hi>Tegea,</hi> took the Walls which the <hi>Athenians</hi> had rebuilt. At the ſame time his Brother <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutias</hi> attended him by Sea with twelve Gallies. <hi>So that their Mother might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly eſteem her ſelf the moſt happy Woman living: for that the ſame day ſhe beheld the ſucceſsful Arms of one of her Sons againſt the Enemies Towns, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels at Land, and of the others againſt their Fleets and Shipyards at Sea. Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> having atchieved this, disbanded the Confederates, and led his own Forces home.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Exiles of <hi>Corinth</hi> how Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſtood there,<note place="margin">Olymp. <hi>97.</hi> Philocles Archon.</note> that they had all their

Ageſilaus,</hi> though they were in view, did not purſue them, but abode in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and offered to <hi>Neptune,</hi> remaining there till the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Exiles had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed and celebrated the Games.</p>
               <p>After his Departure the <hi>Argives</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the <hi>Isthmian</hi> Sports, ſo that this year every Prize was twice won, and the Champions were twice declared Victors. The fourth day <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> led his Army to the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> but when he ſaw it was defended by a ſtrong Gariſon, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again to the City after Dinner, making as if it were to be ſurrendred to him: whereupon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> fearing it might be delivered up to him indeed, ſent for <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> and the greateſt part
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58267:137"/>of the Targetiers. But <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> when he diſcovered that they were paſſed by in the Night, marcht back again by break of day towards the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> and took his way by the Bath, commanding the Regiment to poſſeſs themſelves of the top of an Hill. This Night he encamped himſelf by the Bath, but the Regiment abode on the Hill; and at that time he was famed for a ſlight, though ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, invention: for none of thoſe who carried Proviſions to the Regiment having conveyed fire to them, though it was cold by reaſon of the Rain and Hail in the Evening, and for that being Summer time they had only their Linnen Cloaths on, and lay on the top of a very high Hill, he ſent them ten men with fire in Pots, as they were benummed with cold, in the dark, and without Stomacks. Theſe men ſcrambled up the Hill ſome how or other, and having good ſtore of Wood, made great fires, whereupon the Soldiers anointed themſelves, and ſeveral of them fell to eating afreſh. That Night they diſcovered the Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> on fire, but who fired it none can tell.</p>
               <p>When thoſe in the Town ſaw the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeum</hi> was taken, they no longer made any defence, but Men, Women, Slaves, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58267:137"/>Freemen retired with moſt of the Cattle to <hi>Juno</hi>'s Temple. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> marched with the Army along the Shore, whilſt the Regiment came down the Hill at the ſame time, and took <hi>Oenoe</hi> a ſtrong Place, and all the Booty in it. The ſame day, the Soldiers got abundance of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of thoſe Places, and they that fled into <hi>Juno</hi>'s Temple came out and ſurrendred upon Diſcretion. All the Murderers he ordered to be delivered up to the Exiles, and the reſt to be ſold for Slaves; ſoon after a great number of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners came out of the Temple. Several Ambaſſadors came to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, ſome from the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> to know upon what Terms they might obtain a Peace, but he very ſuperciliouſly did not vouchſafe them ſo much as a look, though introduced by <hi>Pharax,</hi> who had formerly been their Publick Hoſt, but ſat in a round Building near a Lake, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of Priſoners, as they were brought out of the Temple. Theſe the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> attended and guarded with their Pikes, being mightily gazed on. <hi>For uſually the Fortunate and Victorious attract the Eyes of all Spectators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſat ſeemingly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, one came riding up to him with
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58267:138"/>his Horſe in a Foam, and when ſeveral ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him what News, he gave no Anſwer to any one, but approached near <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and ſpringing from his Horſe, related with a ſad countenance the diſaſter that befel the Regiment in the <hi>Lechaeum.</hi> When <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> heard it, he inſtantly flew from his Seat, and took his Lance, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cryer to call the Colonels and Captains, and Commanders of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries; and after they were aſſembled he ordered the reſt, to eat any thing they could get, for they had not yet dined, and follow him with all ſpeed. He himſelf though he had not dined, marched on before, with <hi>Damaſias</hi>'s men, being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Guards with Diligence. By that time he had paſſed the Bath, and reached the Plain of <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> there came three Horſemen riding up to him with the News, that the Bodies of the ſlain were recovered; which when he heard, he commanded the Army to halt, and reſting a while, marched on to <hi>Juno</hi>'s Temple. Next day the Slaves were ſold, and the <hi>Boeotian</hi> Ambaſſadors being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were asked what they came for, they made no mention of Peace, but only told <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> that with his leave, they would go ſpeak with their own Countreymen

                  <hi>There was great Lamentation made in the</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>Army, they being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to ſuch Misfortunes as theſe; yet thoſe whoſe Relations were killed upon the Spot, were gay and merry after their private loſſes, as though they had been Victorious.</hi>

               <p>The Diſaſter that befel the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> was after this manner. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mycleans</hi> always reſort to celebrate the

               <p>Hereupon the Colonel commanded thoſe who were ten years paſt man's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to repulſe the ſaid Targetiers, but being Heavy-armed men, they could not come ſo near as to reach them with their Lances, becauſe the <hi>Athenian</hi> General had commanded the Targetiers to retreat before the Heavy-armed men cloſed with them, but the latter purſuing them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly in ſeveral ſmall Parties, <hi>Iphicrates</hi>'s Targetiers darted their Javelins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ran by galling their Flanks, ſo that nine or ten were killed in the fiſt Onſet.</p>
               <p>After this they attacked the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> more boldly, and when they began to preſs them hard, the Colonel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58267:140"/>thoſe that were fifteen years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove man's eſtate to purſue the Enemy, and in this purſuit they loſt more men than in the former. And now the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of their men were killed; yet a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Horſe coming in to their Relief, they purſued again, and unadviſedly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Targetiers as they retreated, not only till they had killed ſome, but till they came even with the Front of thoſe that were formoſt in the purſuit, and ſo faced about again.</p>
               <p>When they had ſuffered alike the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, their Numbers continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and they began to droop, but the Enemy grew more bold by theſe ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Attempts. At length being in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence what to do, they retired to a little Hill about two furlongs from the Sea, and about ſixteen or ſeventeen from the <hi>Lechaeum;</hi> which when the Gariſon there diſcovered, they got on board ſome Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and coaſted along the Shore, till they came to the Place. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being now reduced to a greater ſtrait, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſuffered extreamly, and loſt a great many men, were not able to make any longer Defence, but when they ſaw the Heavy-armed men come upon them, they fell to ſlight, ſome throwing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58267:140"/>themſelves into the Sea, and a few eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping with the Horſe into the <hi>Lechaeum.</hi> In all the Skirmiſhes and Purſuit there were about two hundred and fifty flain. This is the Account of that Action.</p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> taking with him the Regiment which was defeated, left ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtead of it in the <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> and in his march home, entred the Towns very late, and ſet forth as ſoon as he could; for he marcht out of <hi>Orchomenus</hi> very early, and paſſed by <hi>Mantinea</hi> before it was light; ſo unwilling were the Soldiers to be ſeen by the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> thinking they would rejoyce at their Calamitie! After this, <hi>Iphicrates</hi> was yet more ſucceſsful, for tho <hi>Praxitas</hi> had taken <hi>Sidus</hi> and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myo,</hi> and placed Gariſons in them; and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf of the <hi>Piroeum,</hi> and fortified <hi>Oenoe,</hi> yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took all theſe Places except the <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> which was defended by a Gariſon of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and their Confederates. The Exiles of <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe of the Regiments Defeat, went no longer by Land from <hi>Sicyon,</hi> but by Sea, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thoſe in the City, as well as ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome miſchief from them. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Achaeans</hi> being poſſeſſed of <hi>Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> a Town formerly belonging to the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58267:141"/>
                  <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and naturalizing the <hi>Calydoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> were obliged to maintain a Gariſon therein, becauſe it was blockt up by the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> being joyned by a Body of <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Boeotians,</hi> with whom they were in League. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in diſtreſs, ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon</hi> to complain that they had not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Speech.</note> 
                  <hi>we joyn with you, and ſerve you in your Wars according to your Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but when we were blockt up by the</hi> Acarnanians, <hi>and their Allies, we were the least of your care. If Affairs go thus, it will be impoſſible for us longer to ſubſiſt; ſo that either we muſt let fall the War in</hi> Peloponneſus, <hi>and paſs into our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to make oppoſition againſt the</hi> Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>and their Confederates, or elſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch a Peace as they will pleaſe to give us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they ſaid,<note place="margin">Nicoteles Archon.</note> intimating that they would break their League with the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> unleſs they ſent them Succors. Upon this Speech, the <hi>Ephori</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil reſolved that it was neceſſary to aſſiſt the <hi>Achaeans</hi> againſt the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> and thereupon they ſent out <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> with two Regiments, and a Party of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, with whom the <hi>Achaeans</hi> joyned
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58267:141"/>their whole Force. As ſoon as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> began his Campagne, the <hi>Acarnanian</hi> Countreymen retired into the Gariſons, and drove their Cattel a great way into the Countrey, that they might not be ſurprized by the Enemy. A while after when he arrived in the frontiers, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched one to the Community of the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> at <hi>Stratus,</hi> to let them know, that if they did not quit their League with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> and accept the Alliance of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> he would immediately ravage their Countrey, and lay all waſt before him. They regarded not his Meſſage, and he Made good his Word. For he fell preſently to deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countrey, but did not advance above ten or twelve furlongs a day, ſo that the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> concluding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſecure from the ſlow Progreſs of the Army, drew their Cattel down the Mountains, and ſowed moſt of their Ground.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſuppoſing they were grown over confident, ſacrificed the fifteenth or ſixteenth day after he entred their Territory, and before Night march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hundred and ſixty Furlongs to a certain Lake, where moſt of their Cattel were, and took abundance of Oxen, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58267:142"/>Horſes, with ſeveral ſorts of other Beaſts, as alſo a great many Captives. All which Booty, he ſtaid, and ſold the next day. In the mean while ſeveral of the <hi>Acarnanian</hi> Targetiers came up and made uſe of their Javelins, and Slings, but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus</hi> being encamped on an Hill, ſuſtained no dammage, only the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they were providing Supper were forced to march down into the Plain. At Night when the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> drew off, and ſet their Centinels, the Army repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves. Next day <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, but the Paſs out of the Meadows and Plain, being ſtrait, by reaſon of the Mountains which ſurrounded the Lake, the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of the Hills, and put the Enemy to a great deal of trouble with their Lances and Javelins from the Eminencies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from thence gave them ſuch a diverſion, that they were not able to march any farther. Nor did the Heavy-armed men and Horſe which were drawn out of the Body of the Army with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to purſue, do them any harm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they retired to their faſtneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> conſidering it would be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter for his men, who had been in ſuch hard Service, to force this Paſs,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58267:142"/>reſolved to purſue thoſe that charged in the left, being a ſtrong Party, that had preſſed hard upon them, becauſe this Hill was eaſier for the Heavy-armed men and Horſe to paſs. Whilſt he was ſacrificing the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> put them hard to 't with their Lances, and Javelins, and advancing very near, wounded ſeveral of them. But when he commanded his men to purſue, the heavy-armed men who were fifteen years paſt man's eſtate ran upon them, the Horſe moved, and he himſelf followed with the reſt. Immediately the <hi>Acarnanians</hi> who came down the hill, and made ſome light Skirmiſhes with the Enemy, ſoon turned their backs, and were cut in pieces in their retreat to the aſcent thereof. The <hi>Acar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanian</hi> Heavy-armed men were poſted on the top of the Hill, and continued there with a ſtrong Party of Targetiers, who amongſt others threw their Lances, wherewith they galled the Cavalry, and killed ſome of their Horſes. Yet when they were juſt going to cloſe with the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Heavy-armed men, they fell to flight and about three hundred of them were killed, for which Action <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> erected a Trophy, and after that went ravaging and deſtroying the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:58267:143"/>
               <p>The <hi>Acarnanians</hi> thinking he had done them no Service at all, becauſe he had not taken in any place either by Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Siege, intreated him that if he would condeſcend to nothing elſe, yet that he would ſtay only ſo long as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Enemie's Seed time. He told them they made a very unreaſonable demand. For (ſaid he) I ſhall march hither again the next Summer, and the more they ſow, the more deſirous will they be of Peace. This, he ſaid, and made ſuch a march by Land through <hi>Aetolia,</hi> as neither a ſmall nor a great Army could have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leave of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> but they let him paſs at that time, hoping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>Naupactus</hi> by his Aſſiſtance. At laſt he took his way by <hi>Rhium,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, becauſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> had put to Sea with their Fleet from <hi>Oeniadae,</hi> and ſtopt his paſſage from <hi>Calydon</hi> into <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Demoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Archon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After Winter was paſt, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe got an Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether early in the Spring to make an expedition againſt the <hi>Acarnanians;</hi> but they having intelligence hereof, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they being Inhabitants of an Inland Countrey, ſhould be blockt up by thoſe that deſtroyed their Corn, in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58267:143"/>ſame manner, as if they were beſieged in Towns, ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to make Peace with the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and an Alliance with the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> And this is the Account of the <hi>Acarnanian</hi> Affairs.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to make an Expedition againſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Boeotians,</hi> reſolved to ſend an Army againſt <hi>Argos,</hi> not thinking it ſafe to leave behind them ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a City as that in their Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and at War with them. <hi>Ageſipolis</hi> underſtanding he was to command the Forces, procured an auſpicious Sacrifice for his Voyage, and went to <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleat <hi>Olympia,</hi> to enquire whether he might in Juſtice refuſe the Peace offered by the <hi>Argives,</hi> or not, being they made no Propoſals at any ſeaſonable time, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſhifts to divert the War juſt when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were ready to enter their Territories. The Oracle anſwered, He might lawfully refuſe a Peace, which was not offered at a fit time. From thence he went to <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos</hi> to know whether he was of the ſame Opinion with his Father concerning the Peace, 'twas anſwered, he was. Whereupon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſipolis</hi> drew his Army out of <hi>Phlius,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:58267:144"/>(for there the Forces were aſſembled till he went to both Oracles) and entred the Enemie's Countrey by the way of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Argives</hi> found they could not prevent the War, they as their way was, ſent two Heralds crowned with Garlands to make overtures of Peace. <hi>Ageſipolis,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, that the Gods did not think the Peace was fairly offered, nor did he accept it, but fell on, which cauſed a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and put thoſe of the City and Countrey into a Conſternation. The firſt day he dined in the Countrey of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> and when the uſual Sacrifices were offered, after Supper there happ'ned an Earthquake. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having began their March from home, ſung all of them an Hymn to <hi>Neptune,</hi> ſuppoſing they ſhould return back again, becauſe <hi>Agis</hi> when formerly there hap'ned one in <hi>Elis</hi> had done the like. To which <hi>Ageſipolis</hi> replied, that if the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake had hap'ned before he had entred the Countrey, he ſhould have apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if the God had oppoſed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but ſince it was after, he thought he gave him encouragement to proceed.</p>
               <p>So the next day he ſacrificed to <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and marched a little way into the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58267:144"/>Enemies Countrey. And becauſe <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> had lately made an Expedition againſt <hi>Argos, Ageſipolis</hi> inquired of the Soldiers how near he advanced to the Walls of the City, and how far into the Countrey, ſtriving Champion like to outdo him in every thing. For one time when he was ſhot at from the Turrets, he repaſſed the Ditch that encompaſſed the Walls; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when moſt of the <hi>Argives</hi> were gone to make an Inroad into <hi>Laconia,</hi> he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo near the Gates, that thoſe who guarded them ſhut out the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Horſe that would have put themſelves in; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at the ſame time with them. So that the Horſe were forced to lie as cloſe under the Walls, and the Works, as Bats: and if ſome <hi>Cretans</hi> had not made an Excurſion towards <hi>Nauplia,</hi> ſeveral of the men and Horſes had been deſtroyed by the Arrows. Soon after when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Erctae,</hi> there fell a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt into the Camp, which ſtruck ſome, and aſtoniſht others, ſo that they died. And when he was deſigning to fortifie a ſmall Caſtle at the Paſs over <hi>Coeloſſa,</hi> the Sacrifice wanted <hi>Lobes,</hi> upon which he marched away with his Army, and disbanded it, having very much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58267:145"/>the <hi>Argives</hi> by ſo ſurpriſing an Invaſion.</p>
               <p>After this manner was the War mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Land; I will now relate what paſſed about the ſame time at Sea, and the Maritine Towns, and take notice of thoſe things only which are worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and omit the reſt. When <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazus</hi> and <hi>Conon</hi> had vanquiſht the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> at Sea, they went about firſt to the Iſles, and Maritine Towns, and drove out the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Governours, putting them in hopes, that they would not build Citadels in them, but reſtore them to their Liberty. They, who heard this, were pleaſed and approved of what was done, ſending Preſents very readily to <hi>Pharnabazus;</hi> for <hi>Conon</hi> had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that if he took theſe Meaſures, he would oblige all the Cities, but if he once went about to enſlave them, every particular Place was able to create him trouble, and it was to be feared, that if the <hi>Greeks</hi> apprehended any ſuch Deſign, they would make an Aſſociation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> was governed by <hi>Conon</hi> in this, and went to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he left forty Gallies with <hi>Conon,</hi> ordering him to meet at <hi>Seſtus,</hi> and went to his Government by Land. For <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyllidas</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:58267:145"/>his old Enemy who was at <hi>Aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> at the time of the Sea-fight, did not abandon the Place, as other Governors did theirs, but kept it ſtill in the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and calling the <hi>Abydenians</hi> together, made this Speech to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As you, Gentlemen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dercylli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s Speech to the <hi>Abyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>have been formerly Friends to our State, ſo now it lies in your power to do us a ſignal piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. It is no marvel if Friends conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue faithful in proſperity, but thoſe who remain firm to us, when we are in diſtreſs, ought to be had in perpetual remembrance. Yet our condition is not ſo bad, as totally to be ruined by the loſs of one Sea-fight. For formerly when the</hi> Athenians <hi>Lorded it over the Sea, we were ſtill in ſo good a condition as to deſerve well of our Friends, and to revenge our ſelves of our Enemies. This Example of your fidelity will be the more illuſtrious, becauſe at this time our Friends together with our Fortune have deſerted us. If any apprehend that we ſhall here be blockt up both by Sea and Land, let him conſider, that there is yet no</hi> Grecian <hi>Fleet at Sea, neither will the</hi> Greeks <hi>endure that the</hi> Barbarians <hi>ſhould e'r meddle with the Sovereignty thereof. From whence it follows, that if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58267:146"/>themſelves, they alſo must aſſiſt you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they heard this, they very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily complied, and gave a kind reception to the Governors that were preſent, and ſent for thoſe who were abſent. At this time ſeveral men fit for Service reſorted to <hi>Abydus;</hi> and <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> paſſed over to <hi>Sestos,</hi> a Town oppoſite to it, being not above eight Furlongs diſtant, and got together thoſe, to whom the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> had given Lands in the <hi>Cherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> and the Governours which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Towns in <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe he entertained in the Service, and told them that they ought not to be diſheartned, but rather conſider that in <hi>Aſia</hi> it ſelf, which time out of mind had been in the King's poſſeſſion, <hi>Temnos</hi> and <hi>Aegia</hi> which were no very conſiderable Towns, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places too lived under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own, and paid no Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Perſian. But what ſtronger Town,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>can ye poſſeſs your ſelves of than</hi> Seſtus? <hi>What place is more difficult to be beſieged than it? For he that intends to take it, muſt attack it both by Sea and Land.</hi> With this Speech he abated their Fear. When <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> found <hi>Abydus</hi> and <hi>Seſtos</hi> in this condition he threatned
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58267:146"/>the Townſmen with a War, unleſs they would expel the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> but they regarded him not, and ſo he gave <hi>Conon</hi> Orders to ſcour the Seas, and went himſelf to ravage the <hi>Abydenian</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Yet not being able this way to bring them to a Submiſſion, he went home, and left <hi>Conon</hi> to diſpoſe of the Cities on the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> ſo that by next Spring they might get as great a Fleet together as was poſſible. For <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> being incenſed againſt the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for the Injuries he had ſuffered from their hands, employed his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to invade their Territories, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf on them.</p>
               <p>The Winter was ſpent in theſe Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.<note place="margin">Antineter Archon.</note> Early in the Spring <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> fitted out a good Fleet, and hired Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, ſailing with <hi>Conon</hi> through the Iſles to <hi>Melus,</hi> and went from thence to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> His firſt Arrival was at <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi> where he deſtroyed the Countrey, and made Deſcents into ſeveral other Places on the Sea-coaſt, incommodating the Enemy as much as he could. But being in ſome apprehenſion, that there were no Ports upon the Coaſts, and that Succors might come, or that he might want Proviſions, he ſoon returned, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58267:147"/>ſetting ſail put into Port at <hi>Phaenicus</hi> in <hi>Cithera.</hi> Here the Gariſon fearing that they ſhould be beſieged and taken, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Town. Theſe he let go with a Paſs to <hi>Laconia,</hi> and having repaired the <hi>Cytherian</hi>'s Walls left a Gariſon in the Place under the Command of the Governour <hi>Nicophebus</hi> an <hi>Athenian.</hi> When he had performed this he went to the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and encouraged the Confederates to make a vigorous War, and approve themſelves faithful to the King. After that he left them all the Money he had, and ſailed to his own Countrey. But <hi>Conon</hi> told him, that if he would give him the Command of the Fleet, he would maintain it out of the Iſlands, and return to <hi>Athens,</hi> where by the help of his Countreymen he would rebuild the Long-walls, and the Wall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> knowing that nothing could mortifie the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> more. Moreover, ſaid he, you will oblige the <hi>Athenians</hi> hereby, <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge your ſelf on the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by rendring that, wherein they have ſo much laboured, ineffectual.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> heard his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals he ſent him very readily to <hi>Athens,</hi> and gave him Money wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58267:147"/>the Walls. Accordingly <hi>Conon</hi> went thither, and disburſing what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, rebuilt a great part of the Wall by the help of his own Sea-men, together with the Carpenters and Maſons which he hired. Another part, the <hi>Athenians, Boeotians,</hi> and others built at their own Charge. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> fitting out a Fleet with the money <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> left them, made <hi>Agathinus</hi> their Admiral, and became Lords of the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and the Bay <hi>Lechaeum:</hi> On the other hand the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſet out a Fleet againſt them, and made <hi>Polemarchus</hi> their Admiral, but, he being ſlain in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and his Vice-Admiral dying of his Wounds, <hi>Herippidas</hi> took the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thereof. Moreover <hi>Proaenus</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Agathinus</hi> in his Command, and parted from <hi>Rhium,</hi> of which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſoon after poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed themſelves. A while after <hi>Teleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi> went to ſucceed <hi>Herippidas</hi> in the Fleet, and recovered the Command of the Bay.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> receiving Intelligence that <hi>Conon</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built the Walls of <hi>Athens,</hi> and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fleet with the King's Money, that ſo he might reduce ſeveral of the Iſlands
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58267:148"/>and Maritine Towns to the Obedience of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> thought with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if they acquainted <hi>Teribazus</hi> the King's General with theſe things, they ſhould either make him their Ally, or prevail with him to withdraw his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from <hi>Conon</hi>'s Fleet. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to ſend <hi>Antalcidas,</hi> and ordered him to give <hi>Teribazus</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the State of Affairs, and to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a Peace between the Republick and the King. But on the contrary, the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſcenting his Deſign ſent their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,<note place="margin">Conon, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes, Din, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes, Callimedon.</note> deſiring the Confederates to joyn theirs, and accordingly ſome went from the <hi>Boeotians, Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives.</hi> When they came to <hi>Teribazus, Antalcidas</hi> acquainted him that his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was to deſire a Peace of the King for the Republick, and ſuch an one too, as the King himſelf would gladly have. For the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would not contend with the King about the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but be ſatisfied, if the Iſles and the other Cities only might enjoy their own Laws. <hi>And why then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſince our Deſign is ſuch, do the reſt of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>or the King make War upon us? or to what end does he waſt his Treaſure? For the</hi> Athenians <hi>cannot make War againſt the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58267:148"/>King, without our Conduct, nor we, if the Cities be reſtored to their Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teribazus</hi> was hugely taken with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talcidas</hi>'s Propoſals, though the oppoſite Party thought they were but mere talk: for the <hi>Athenians</hi> were afraid to conſent that the Cities, and Iſlands ſhould enjoy their own Laws, leſt they ſhould loſe <hi>Lemnos, Imbrus,</hi> and <hi>Scirus,</hi> the <hi>Thebans,</hi> leſt they ſhould be obliged to reſtore the Cities of <hi>Baeotia</hi> to their Liberty; the <hi>Argives</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, leſt they ſhould forgo <hi>Corinth,</hi> which they earneſtly deſired to retain; yet at laſt this Treaty came to nothing, and the Ambaſſadors departed home. <hi>Teribazus</hi> though he thought it not ſafe for him to joyn with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> except he had the Kings Orders for it; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs gave <hi>Antalcidas</hi> Money underhand, for the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to fit out a Fleet with, that ſo they, and their Allies might be the more diſpoſed to a Peace. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he kept <hi>Conon</hi> Priſoner for the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had done the King, believing the report that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> gave of him.</p>
               <p>After that he went up to acquaint the King with what the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſaid, and that he had ſeized <hi>Conon</hi> as an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to know how he ſhould govern
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58267:149"/>himſelf in theſe Affairs. When he came to Court, the King ſent <hi>Struthas</hi> to take care of the Fleet, one firmly addicted to the Intereſt of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and their Allies, not forgetting what the King's Provinces had ſuffered by <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi> But when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſaw he was ill affected towards them, and favoured the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they ſent <hi>Thimbro</hi> to manage the War againſt him, who paſſed into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſus, Priene, Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eophrys, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilleum-</note> and marching with his Forces from the Towns ſituate in the Plains of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> he haraſſed and deſtroyed the King's Countrey. A while after <hi>Struthas</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that <hi>Thimbro</hi> always went out in diſorder, and contemned his Enemy, ſent a Party of Horſe into the Plains, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to make an Excurſion, and drive before them what Booty they could light on. At that time <hi>Thimbro</hi> was at Dinner in <hi>Therſander</hi>'s Tent, who was not only a good Piper, but a Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Robuſtneſs, having been brought up in the <hi>Spartan</hi> Diſcipline. <hi>Struthas</hi> obſerving that the formoſt were but a ſmall Party, and charged in diſorder, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with a ſtrong Body of Horſe in excellent order, and at the firſt Onſet killed <hi>Thimbro</hi> and <hi>Therſander.</hi> After theſe fell they put the reſt to flight, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58267:149"/>cut in pieces a great many in the Purſuit: Some eſcaped to the Towns of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, but the greater part periſhed for want of timely aſſiſtance. For <hi>Thim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro</hi> at that time, as at ſeveral others, went to relieve his men, without acquainting the main Body of his Forces therewith: and thus Affairs ſtood in <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> who were baniſhed by the Populacy, came to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> and declared how diſhonourable it would be to let the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſubdue <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and get ſuch an Acceſſion of Strength. Hereupon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> conſidering, if the People prevailed that <hi>Rhodes</hi> would fall into the hands of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but if the Principal men, into theirs, fitted out eight Sail under the Command of <hi>Ecdicus,</hi> and ſent <hi>Diphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> on Board them, with order to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and keep thoſe Cities faithful which had received <hi>Thimbro,</hi> to recruit the Forces which were left, and to make War with them upon <hi>Struthas. Diphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> obſerved his Orders, and amongſt his other Succeſſes took <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and his Wife the Daughter of <hi>Struthas</hi> in their Journey to <hi>Sardes;</hi> on whom he ſet ſo high a Ranſome, that with it he raiſed Money enough to pay his Army. He
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58267:150"/>was had in as great eſteem by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as <hi>Thimbro,</hi> being one who had the Government of himſelf, and accompliſht whatſoever he undertook. When <hi>Ecdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> arrived at <hi>Cnidus,</hi> and underſtood that the people were Maſters both at Sea and Land, and that they had a Fleet as ſtrong again as his, he lay ſtill: But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hearing that he had too ſmall a force to aſſiſt their Allies with, ordered <hi>Teleutias</hi> to ſail about to him with twelve Ships, that he lay with in the Bay of <hi>Achaia</hi> and the <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> to diſcharge <hi>Ecdicus,</hi> to protect all thoſe who would come in to their Alliance, and to do the Enemy what miſchief he could. After <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leutias</hi> came to <hi>Samos,</hi> he took ſome Ships from thence, and ſailed to <hi>Cnidus; Ecdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> went home: but <hi>Teleutias</hi> went to <hi>Rhodes</hi> with a Fleet of ſeven and twenty Sail, and in his way thither met with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locrates,</hi> Son of <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> going with ten Gallies from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Evagoras,</hi> and took them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here an accident hapned which thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both their Deſigns; for the</hi> Athenians <hi>being in league with the King, aſſisted</hi> Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras <hi>his Enemy; and though the</hi> Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians <hi>were at war with the King, yet</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:58267:150"/>Teleutias <hi>destroyed thoſe that went to fight againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Teleutias</hi> returned to <hi>Cni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and ſold the Prizes, from whence he went to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and ſuccoured the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi> party. Upon this the <hi>Athenians</hi> fearing the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> might recover the Soveraignty of the Sea, ſent out <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſybulus</hi> the <hi>Styrenſian</hi> with forty Sail of Ships, who put to Sea, but went not to the relief of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> ſuppoſing it would be no eaſie matter for him to infeſt the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Allies, who had the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to protect them by land, and <hi>Teleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi> ready with his Fleet at Sea: Nor could the Allies be ſubdued, becauſe they had Gariſons were ſtronger, and had been victorious. Thereupon he ſailed to the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and meeting with no Enemy, thought he could do ſome ſignal piece of Service; for being at firſt inform'd that there was a Rupture between <hi>Amadocus</hi> King of the <hi>Odryſians</hi> and <hi>Seuthes,</hi> Lord of the Seacoaſt of <hi>Thrace,</hi> he made them Friends, and received them into the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, concluding if theſe were at amity, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities in <hi>Thrace</hi> would adhere more firmly to the <hi>Athenian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>Having ſetled Affairs in ſo good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58267:151"/>and being in amity with the <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic</hi> Cities, by reaſon of the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he went to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and ſold the Cuſtoms of thoſe Ships which came from the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and changed the Government of the <hi>Byzantines</hi> from an Ariſtocracy to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, ſo that the <hi>Byzantines</hi> were not at all concern'd to ſee ſuch numbers of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> in their City. When he had performed this, and made an Alliance with the <hi>Chalcedonians,</hi> he ſailed out of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and finding all the Towns in <hi>Lesbos,</hi> except <hi>Mitylene,</hi> take part with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> he attackt no place till he had firſt taken four hundred men out of his Fleet at <hi>Mitylene,</hi> and form'd them and the Exiles who had fled thither into a body, and joyn'd them with the ſtouteſt men of the <hi>Mitylenians:</hi> He gave every one of them hopes; To the <hi>Mitylenians,</hi> that if he maſtered the reſt of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> they ſhould command the whole: To the Exiles, that if they aſſiſted him in the recovery of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Towns, they would be in a capacity of being reſtored to their own Countries again: To the Seamen, that if they could bring <hi>Lesbos</hi> into the Alliance of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> they ſhould greatly enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:58267:151"/>
               <p>When he had thus encouraged the men, he drew them up, and marched with them to <hi>Mithymna:</hi> But <hi>Therimachus</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the place for the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> underſtanding <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> was coming againſt him, took the Seamen from on board his Ships, together with the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymnean</hi> and <hi>Mitylenian</hi> Exiles, and met him at the Frontiers where they had an Engagement, in which <hi>Therimachus</hi> was killed, and a great many ſlain in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. After this he took ſome Cities by compoſition, but foraged the Country about thoſe which held out, and raiſed pay for his Souldiers out of the Spoyls: From thence he haſtened to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to levy a ſtrong body of men there, and when he had raiſed Contribution at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, he went to <hi>Aſpendus,</hi> and ſailed up the River <hi>Eurymedon</hi> with his Fleet.</p>
               <p>He had formerly received money from the <hi>Aſpendians,</hi> and now the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being injured by the Souldiers, they in a rage fell upon the <hi>Athenians</hi> by night, and killed <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> in his Tent, who ended his days in this manner, having had the reputation of being a good man. The <hi>Athenians</hi> choſe <hi>Argyrius</hi> to ſucceed him in the Fleet.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:58267:152"/>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> receiving intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had ſold the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Pontic</hi> Ships at <hi>Byzantium,</hi> that they were poſſeſt of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and that the other Cities on the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> were in a good condition, becauſe <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus</hi> was their Ally; thought it was high time to look about them: And altho' they could object nothing againſt <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyllidas,</hi> yet <hi>Anaxibius</hi> by favour of the <hi>Ephori</hi> procured himſelf to go Governour of <hi>Abydus,</hi> and undertook, if they would give him a Fleet and pay off his men, to make War with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> after ſuch a rate as ſhould change the face of things in the <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> Hereupon they gave him three Gallies, and Pay for a thouſand Mercenaries, and diſpatched him away: When he arrived he raiſed more Forces, and wreſted ſome of the <hi>Eolic</hi> Towns from <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and whilſt he was gone againſt <hi>Abydus</hi> with his own Army and the Forces of the other Cities, <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> on the contrary fell upon them, and laid waſt their Territories: Afterwards he fitted out three Ships more at <hi>Abydus,</hi> beſides thoſe he had, and when he took any Ships that belonged either to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> or their Confederates, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them in thither.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:58267:152"/>
               <p>When the <hi>Athenians</hi> received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hereof, they feared he would undo all that <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> had done before in the <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> whereupon they ſent out <hi>Iphicrates</hi> againſt him with eight Sail, and 1200 Targetiers, being moſt of thoſe he commanded at <hi>Corinth.</hi> For the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives</hi> having poſſeſt themſelves of <hi>Corinth,</hi> declared they had no occaſion for them, becauſe <hi>Iphicrates</hi> had put ſome to death, who favoured their intereſt; whereupon he return'd home, and lived privately. When he arrived at the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> he and <hi>Anaxibius</hi> ſent out Foragers on both ſides, and with them they carried on the War one with another. A while after <hi>Iphicrates</hi> hearing that <hi>Anaxibius</hi> was gone to <hi>Antandrus</hi> with the <hi>Mercenaries, Lacedemonians,</hi> and 200 <hi>Abydenian</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-arm'd men, and underſtanding that <hi>Antandrus</hi> had ſurrendred to him, he gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he would put in a Gariſon there, and return with the <hi>Abydenians:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he paſſed over in the Night at a place which was freeſt from the diſcovery of the <hi>Abydenians,</hi> and when he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf of the Hills, he placed an Ambuſh: He commanded alſo the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which tranſported him to cruiſe off the ſhoar by break of day, that they

Nor was he miſtaken, for though <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> had not an auſpicious Sacrifice, yet he departed from <hi>Antandrus,</hi> and deſpiſed the Ceremonies, partly becauſe he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a Friends Country, and to a City of the Confederates, partly becauſe he underſtood by thoſe he met, that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicrates</hi> was ſailed back to <hi>Praeconne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and therefore marched more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly.</p>
               <p>

               <p>THis was the ſtate of Affairs betwixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the <hi>Helleſpont:</hi> The people of <hi>Aegina</hi> formerly had Commerce, with the <hi>Athenians</hi> till the War broke out; and then <hi>Eteonicus</hi> coming thither with the conſent of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> gave Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to any that would, to make Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in <hi>Attica.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> being in a manner beſieged by the <hi>Aegineans,</hi> ſent a body of heavy-armed men into <hi>Aegina,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and blockt them up with a Wall by Land, and ten Gallies by Sea.</p>

                  <hi>Hierax</hi> having left twelve Gallies, and <hi>Gorgopas</hi> his Vice-Admiral Governour of <hi>Aegina,</hi> ſailed with the reſt of the Fleet to <hi>Rhodes.</hi> From this time the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in their own Works lookt more like the Beſieged, than thoſe in the Town; whereupon a good Fleet was order'd to be fitted out, and to fetch off their Army the fifth Month of the Siege: after which they were again infeſted by <hi>Gorgopas,</hi> and the Privatiers. Againſt theſe they ſet out thirteen Sail under the Command of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomus:</hi> Whilſt <hi>Hierax</hi> was at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent <hi>Antalcidas</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Sea, thinking thereby they ſhould highly oblige <hi>Teribazus. Antalcidas</hi> when
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58267:156"/>he arrived at <hi>Aegina,</hi> took <hi>Gorgopas</hi>'s Fleet with him, and ſailed to <hi>Epheſus;</hi> ſending <hi>Gorgopas</hi> back again to the former place with ten Sail, and gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the reſt to <hi>Nicolochus</hi> his Vice-Admiral, who went from thence with Succors to the <hi>Abydenians,</hi> and directing his Courſe to <hi>Tenedos,</hi> deſtroyed the Country, and having raiſed Contribution ſailed to <hi>Abydus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Generals from <hi>Samothra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Thaſus,</hi> and the adjacent places, came together to relieve the <hi>Tenedians;</hi> but being certified that <hi>Nicolochus</hi> was gone to <hi>Abydus,</hi> they ſet out of the <hi>Cherſoneſe</hi> with two and thirty Sail of Ships, and blockt him up with his Fleet of five and twenty.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Gorgopas</hi> parted from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and meeting with <hi>Eunomus,</hi> the former whereof ran into <hi>Aegina,</hi> a little before Sun-ſet, and put his men aſhoar, ordering them to ſup. <hi>Eunomus</hi> having made a ſhort ſtay there, ſet ſail. The night coming on he went a-head of the Fleet, and as the cuſtom is, hung out his Lights, that the Ships a-ſtern might not miſtake their way: Thereupon <hi>Gorgopas</hi> put his men on board immediately, and followed the Lights at a diſtance, that he might not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58267:156"/>be diſcovered, nor give notice to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the Pilots alſo uſed a noiſe made with Stones, and the ſtrokes of the Oars, inſtead of the Voice. Whilſt <hi>Eunomus</hi> lay with his Fleet under the ſhoar near <hi>Cape Zoster</hi> in <hi>Attica; Gorgopas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Trumpets to ſound, and an Attack to be made: At this time ſome of <hi>Eunomus</hi>'s men were newly gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar, ſome putting into Harbour, and others ſtill out at Sea: The Fight was by Moon-light, and in it <hi>Gorgopas</hi> took four Sail, which he laſht faſt to his own Ships, and towed them to <hi>Aegina;</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet run into the <hi>Piraeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Chabrias</hi> went to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Evagoras,</hi> with ten Sail, and eight hundred Targetiers; beſides which he took ſome more Ships and Heavy-arm'd men from <hi>Athens,</hi> and making a deſcent in the Night upon <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina,</hi> placed his Targetiers in Ambuſcade in an hollow beyond the Temple of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules:</hi> At Day-break the <hi>Athenian</hi> Heavy-arm'd men led by <hi>Demaenetus,</hi> came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to agreement, and marched up about ſixteen Furlongs beyond the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the<note n="*" place="margin">A place called from its three Towers.</note> 
                  <hi>Tripyrgia. Gorgopas</hi> having Intelligence hereof, came with the <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi> Sea-men, and the eight <hi>Spartan</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:58267:157"/>Commiſſioners, to fight the Enemy; and commanded Proclamation to be made, That thoſe Seamen who were Freemen, ſhould come to his aſſiſtance; whereupon ſeveral getting ſuch Arms as they could light on, joyn'd him: After the Van had paſſed the Ambuſh, <hi>Chabrias</hi>'s men roſe up on a ſudden, darting their Lances and throwing their Javelins: By this time the heavy-armed men from on board the Ships were come up, but the advanc'd Guard of the Enemy being not in a cloſe body, were ſoon cut in pieces, and amongſt them <hi>Gorgopas</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> when theſe fell, the reſt fled, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty <hi>Aegineans</hi> were ſlain; of the Mercenaries, Foreigners and Seamen, that ſtragled, there were no leſs than two hundred killed.</p>
               <p>From that time the <hi>Athenians</hi> had an undiſturbed Navigation as in time of Peace, for the Seamen would not obey <hi>Eteonicus,</hi> nor enter the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, though he preſſed them, becauſe they were not payd. Thereupon the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> ſent <hi>Teleutias</hi> again to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Fleet, at whoſe coming the Seamen were tranſported with joy; when he called them together, he made this Speech to them.</p>

                  <hi>yet by the favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and your diligence, I'le endeavour to procure you plenty of all Neceſſaries: For aſſure your ſelves, that whilst you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my command, your welfare is as dear to me as my own life. Perhaps you all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at me, for ſaying, that I had rather you ſhould be provided with Neceſſaries, than my ſelf: I take Heaven to witneſs, that I had rather want Bread my ſelf two days, than that you ſhould want it one. My door was formerly open to every one that asked any thing of me, and ſo it ſhall be for the future. When you are better ſtored with Proviſions, you ſhall then ſee me live more plentifully. If you ſee me endure cold, heat, and watching: aſſure your ſelves, that you must do ſo too. Nor do I command you theſe things, as if I delighted to puniſh you, but that you may make an advantage of them: Take for your example our</hi> Republick <hi>which is in ſo flouriſhing a condition, yet arrived not to this felicity by ſloth, but by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary engagement in the fatigue and dangers of War, when ever occaſion ſerved. To my knowledge you have heretofore been gallant men, but now ſtrive to approve your ſelves yet braver, that we may contentedly better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh together the Advantages ariſing from
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58267:158"/>our labours: For what can be greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, than not to be obliged to fawn on any</hi> Greek <hi>or</hi> Barbarian <hi>for Pay; but to be able of our ſelves to procure Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, from whence they may be most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably obtained? For certainly large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from the Enemy in time of War, not only ſupply you with Proviſions, but gain you Reputation throughout the World.</hi>

               <p>When he had ended his Speech, the whole Army with a loud Acclamation bid him command them any Service whatſoever, and they would obey: After he had Sacrificed, he ſpoke to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

                  <hi>Come (fellow Souldiers) take the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you intended, and one Days Proviſions; then go on board forthwith, that we may bend our courſe whither Heaven directs, and arrive opportunely.</hi>

               <p>This was the firſt Peace, that was made between the <hi>Lacedemonians, Athenians,</hi> and their Allies ſince the Walls of <hi>Athens</hi> were demoliſhed. <hi>And though the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians <hi>did in a manner ballance the power of the Enemies during the War, yet they gained themſelves a great deal of Reputation from that called the</hi> Antal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidean <hi>Peace, which the King of</hi> Perſia <hi>Propoſed.</hi> For they being <hi>Guarrantees</hi> of it, reſtored the Cities to their Liberty, made <hi>Corinth</hi> their Ally, and, as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſired, freed the <hi>Boeotian</hi> Towns from the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Beſides they obliged the <hi>Argives</hi> to quit their Pretenſions to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and decreed to ſend an Army againſt them, unleſs they abandoned the Place.</p>

               <p>Beſides the<note n="*" place="margin">This Truce was made the XIV year of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopon.</hi> War, <hi>Thucyd. Lib. V. Dexitheus Archon.</hi>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58267:162"/>about the Town, carrying on the Works with one half of the Army, and defending thoſe that were employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them with the other. After the Lines were finiſhed, he encompaſſed the Town about with a Wall, without any loſs: but when he underſtood, that it was well ſtored with Proviſions, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer having been a plentiful Year, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twould be an hard caſe to wear out the Army, and Allies with a long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he dammed up a large River that ran through the Town, and ſtopping its courſe, raiſed it above the Foundations of the Walls, and Houſes: Whereupon the lowermoſt Bricks being moiſtned, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the uppermoſt, and the Wall cracking leaned; upon that the <hi>Mantine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> propped it up with Wood, and made a Work to prevent the Tower from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But when they ſaw they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by the Water, fearing the Wall would drop down quite round, whereby they ſhould eaſily fall into the Enemie's hands, they conſented to demoliſh it. But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would hearken to no Terms, unleſs they would conſent to live in Villages. The <hi>Mantineans</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves neceſſitated yielded to their Conditions. They that favoured
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58267:163"/>the <hi>Argives,</hi> and Chief men apprehended, they ſhould ſuffer death, but <hi>Pauſanias</hi> prevailed with his Son <hi>Ageſipolis</hi> for ſixty of them to depart the Town with ſafe Conduct. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſtood on both ſides from the Gates with their Pikes to view them as they marcht out, and though they hated the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> yet the Private Soldiers forbore them with much more moderation, than the Officers of the <hi>Mantineans</hi> would have done; which I have mentioned as a teſtimony of great Obedience to their Commanders.</p>
               <p>From this time the Walls were pulled down, and <hi>Mantinea</hi> divided into four Parts, being inhabited as in former times. The People were troubled at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were obliged to pull down their Houſes, and build others anew. Yet they became well ſatisfied with the change, being nearer their Eſtates, which lay juſt by the Villages, being governed by an Ariſtocracy, and delivered from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Demagogues; ſo that when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent an Officer to each Village to raiſe men, they came into the Service with more readineſs, than when they were governed by a Democracy. Theſe were the Tranſactions at <hi>Mantinea. By which others may learn not to draw

               <p>The <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Exiles obſerving that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took an Account of all the Allies bevaviour towards them in the War,<note place="margin">Olymp. <hi>99.</hi> Diotrephes Archon.</note> and ſuppoſing they had now a fair opportunity in their hands, went to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi> and repreſented, that whilſt they enjoyed their Countrey, their City both received the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in all their Expeditions. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were expulſt, the reſt would ſerve the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in no capacity, they of all men being excluded their City: When the <hi>Ephori</hi> heard this, they thought it a matter worthy their conſideration, and ſent a Meſſage to the Community of the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> to let them know that the Exiles were well affected to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and that they were unjuſtly baniſhed; as alſo to deſire that they might be reſtored with their Conſent and not by Force. This put the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> in a fear, leſt ſome in the Town ſhould let in the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> if they appeared before it with an Army.

Thus the Affair about the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Exiles was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted at that time.</p>
               <p>Soon after there came Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> from <hi>Acanthus,</hi> and <hi>Apollonia,</hi> which were the greateſt Cities near <hi>Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</hi> When the <hi>Ephori</hi> underſtood their Errand, they introduced them to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and Confederates, where <hi>Cligenes</hi> the <hi>Acanthian</hi> made this Speech.</p>

                     <hi>Clygenes</hi>'s Speech.</note> and you the Allies) <hi>that there is now a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſchief in</hi> Greece, <hi>of which you have not yet taken notice. Moſt of you know that</hi> Olynthus <hi>is the greateſt City in</hi> Thrace, <hi>the Inhabitants whereof have drawn ſome Towns into their Alliance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Terms to enjoy the ſame Laws, and live in the ſame Community. They have united ſome of the more conſiderable Cities, and attempted to wreſt the</hi> Macedonian <hi>Towns from the Allegiance of</hi> Amyntas <hi>their King: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the coming in of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58267:164"/>Places, they ſoon proceeded to thoſe more remote, and bigger: Amongſt ſeveral other Cities we left them poſſeſt of</hi> Pella, <hi>which is far the greatest of any in</hi> Macedon. <hi>Since, we understand that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas <hi>abandons his Towns, and may be ſaid to be only not diſpoſſeſt of all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The</hi> Olynthians <hi>ſent, to us, and the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonians, <hi>a threatning Meſſage, how that if we joyned them not, they would turn their Arms upon us. We deſire</hi> (My Lords) <hi>to enjoy our own Laws, and live under our own Government; but if none will aſſiſt us, we muſt of neceſſity aſſociate. They have no leſs than eight hundred Heavy-armed men, of Targetiers a greater number, and if we joyn with them, they will make above a thouſand Horſe. Beſides, we left the</hi> Athenian, <hi>and</hi> Boeotian <hi>Ambaſſadors there, and we heard that the</hi> Olynthians <hi>had decreed to ſend theirs, to treat of a League Offenſive, and Defenſive with theſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Cities: if therefore the</hi> Athenians, <hi>and</hi> Thebans <hi>gain ſuch an Acceſſion of Strength, beware they prove not too many for you. Moreover, ſeeing they are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of</hi> Potidaea <hi>on the</hi> Iſthmus <hi>of</hi> Pallene, <hi>it's certain that thoſe Towns which are within it, will fall into their hands. The Conſternation thoſe Cities are in may be a

Again, conſider with your ſelves, how can you in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity prevent all</hi> Boeotia, <hi>from Aſſociating; when you regard not the Conjunction of a greater force, that gathers ſtrength ſo faſt both by Sea, and Land. What can hinder them? they have Timber enough in their own Countrey for Shipping. They can't want Money, for they have Cuſtoms from their Ports and Towns of Mart, their Plenty alſo makes them Populous. Beſides all this, the</hi> Thracians <hi>who are their Neighbours, and not under a Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, do now careſs them. And if they be ſubdued by them, this alſo will be a formidable addition to their Power; and if all theſe Deſigns ſucceed, the Gold Mines at</hi> Pangaeus <hi>muſt of neceſſity follow. I'll mention nothing now, but what is the common talk of the Town. What need I tell you of their haughty Minds? their Spirit, and Ambition, who can expreſs?</hi> Perhaps God and Nature have ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved man, that as our Fortune, ſo our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Humor ſhould alſo riſe. <hi>We</hi> (My Lords) <hi>have faithfully repreſented to you
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58267:165"/>the State of Affairs, and now 'tis your part to conſider whether they be worthy your regard or not. This I muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to tell you too, that their Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is great, yet it is not ſo formidable as you need fear to grapple with. The Towns which were forct into the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, when they ſee a Power on foot will ſoon fly off again. But if once they be linkt together with inter-marriages, and Commerce (which they have made a Law to encourage) and ſhall apprehend how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious it is to follow the Victor</hi> (as the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who whilſt they ſided with you, both ſaved themſelves, and plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red others) <hi>perhaps it will be no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſſolve their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>

                  <hi>This very day,</hi> Phoebidas, <hi>it lies in your power to do your Country a ſignal piece of Service; for if you will follow me with your Heavy-armed men, I will bring you into the Citadel; and when this is done, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelf</hi> Thebes <hi>will be wholly at the Devotion of the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>and us your Friends: You ſee it has been decreed, that no</hi> Theban <hi>ſhould follow you to the</hi> Olynthian <hi>Wars; but if you will joyn with us in this Deſign, we will ſend a ſtrong Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Heavy-armed men and Horſe, that you may hereby re-inforce your Brother

               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Phaebidas</hi> heard this, he was hugely tranſported, for he loved the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a noble Enterprize more than life it ſelf, though he never had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a prudent and thinking man. After it was concluded on, <hi>Leontiades</hi> bid him march forward, as though he was preparing for his Voyage; and when it is time, ſaid he, I will come and Conduct you my ſelf. The Senate was ſitting at that time in the Porch of the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, becauſe the Women kept the Feaſt of <hi>Ceres</hi> in the Citadel, and the Streets were thin (it being Summer-time, and the heat of the day) when <hi>Leontiades rode</hi> after <hi>Phaebidas,</hi> and calling him back, led him directly to the Citadel, where having poſted <hi>Phaebidas</hi> and his men, he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the Keys of the Gates, adviſing him to let none enter without his Order. From thence he went ſtrait to the Senate, and being come thither, ſpake thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords, Be not diſheartned, though the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>are poſſeſt of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; for they declare they come not to any in an hostile manner, but ſuch as love ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility.

               </p>
               <p>They that were privy to the Deſign drawing near, obey'd, and laid hold on <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menias,</hi> the others that knew nothing of the matter, and were Enemies to <hi>Leonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi>'s Faction, immediately left the Town, fearing they ſhould be put to death, the reſt having retired home before. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they underſtood that <hi>Iſmenias</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> thoſe that were of his and <hi>Androclides</hi>'s Faction, being about four hundred, fled to <hi>Athens.</hi> Upon this they choſe another chief Magiſtrate inſtead of <hi>Iſmenias. Leontiades</hi> went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where he found the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and people much offended at <hi>Phaebidas</hi> for having acted without Orders.

                  <hi>Leontiades</hi> came to the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he made this Speech.</p>

                  <hi>My Lords of</hi> Lacedemon,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>You your ſelves confeſs, that the</hi> Thebans <hi>were diſpoſed to a War before theſe Tranſactions; you perceivod too, that they always favoured your Enemies and hated your Friends: They would not aſſist you against the people in the</hi> Piraeus <hi>that made ſo fierce oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against you; yet they made War upon the</hi> Phoceans, <hi>only becauſe they were well affected towards you: Nay when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that you employed your Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the</hi> Olynthians, <hi>they made an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them, and you continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to hear that they had reduced</hi> Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia. <hi>Now ſince Affairs ſtand thus, you need not have any apprehenſions of the</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans; <hi>one ſhort private Letter will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to render every thing there agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your deſires, Provided you will as cordially eſpouſe our Interest as we do yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> heard this, they decreed that as the Citadel had been ſurprized, ſo it ſhould be kept; and that <hi>Iſmenias</hi> ſhould be brought to his Tryal. Soon after they ſent three Judges of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and of the Confederates one from each City both ſmall and great.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58267:168"/>The Judges being ſat, <hi>Iſmenias</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for holding Correſpondence with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and for contracting a Friendſhip with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which was out of no good deſign to <hi>Greece;</hi> and for ſharing of the Money ſent by the King, and for being together with <hi>Androclides</hi> the chief Fomenter of all the Troubles in <hi>Greece.</hi> To all this he pleaded, yet could not clear himſelf from being thought an Enterprizer of great Deſigns, and thoſe not very good ones; ſo he was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed. Hereupon <hi>Leontiades</hi>'s Party being poſſeſſed of the City, were more obſervant of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> than was expected from them.</p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> purſued the War againſt the <hi>Olynthians</hi> more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, and ſent <hi>Teleutias</hi> General, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing out Orders for the raiſing an Army of ten thouſand men, and directed their Letters to the Confederate Towns, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to follow <hi>Teleutias</hi> in the Expedition purſuant to the Decree of the Allies. Wherefore amongſt others that freely offered their Service to him, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon no ways ungrateful to thoſe that ſerv'd under him) the City of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> ſent him, being the Brother of <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> both Heavy-arm'd men and Horſe.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58267:169"/>He made no extraordinary haſt, but took all poſſible care that the Army might do their Friends no harm in their march; and to raiſe as great Forces as he poſſibly could, he alſo diſpatched a Meſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Amyntas,</hi> requiring him to hire ſome Mercenaries, and diſtribute money amongſt the Kings his Neighbours, if ſo be he had any thoughts of recovering his Kingdom. Beſides he ſent to <hi>Derdas</hi> Prince of <hi>Elimea,</hi> to let him know that the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthians</hi> had already ſubdued the greater Monarchy, which was that of <hi>Macedone;</hi> nor would they forbear a leſſer, unleſs their Inſolence were checkt.</p>
               <p>When he had diſpatcht theſe Affairs, and drawn a very powerful Army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he marched to the Frontiers of the Conſederates, and arriving at <hi>Potidaea,</hi> made a general Muſter, and entred the Enemies Country. But when he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards <hi>Olynthus,</hi> he neither burned nor deſtroyed any thing, ſuppoſing if he took any ſuch courſe, it would hinder him both in his March and Retreat; yet it would do well to cut down the Trees when he retired from the Walls of the City, and thereby divert the Enemy from falling on his Rear. As ſoon as he came within leſs than ten Furlongs of the City,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58267:169"/>he halted, leading the left Wing himſelf; the other Body of the Confederates being placed in the right: For ſo it hapned, that he marched towards the Gate, at which the Enemy went out. The <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian,</hi> and <hi>Theban</hi> Horſe together with the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he placed in the right, keeping <hi>Derdas</hi> with his four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe near him: partly becauſe he admired theſe Troops, and partly to ſhew reſpect to <hi>Derdas,</hi> thereby to oblige him the more to the Service.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Enemy ſallying out of the Town, drew up under the Walls, and marſhalling their Horſe in a cloſe Body, charged the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Baeoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and beating <hi>Polycharmus</hi> General of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Cavalry of his Horſe, gave him a great many wounds as he lay on the ground, and killed ſome others. At laſt the Horſe in the right were rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they flying the Foot that were next them gave ground, ſo that the whole Army was in danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, had not <hi>Derdas</hi> advanced with his Horſe to the Gates of the City, and <hi>Teleutias</hi> ſeconded him with his Troops in good order: which when the <hi>Olynthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Cavalry perceived, they faced about, and retreated with great diligence, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould be cut off from the Gates.

                  <hi>Derdas</hi> killed a great many of their Horſe as they paſſed by him, but the Infantry being near the Walls, retired back into the Town without much loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teleutias</hi> having obtained this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, erected a Trophy, cut down the Trees, and retreated, disbanding the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Troops, and thoſe of <hi>Derdas</hi> at the end of the Campagn. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Olynthians</hi> making ſeveral Incurſions into the Territories of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Confederates, ravaged the Country, and killed the Inhabitants.</p>

When he ſaw the Inroad he lay ſtill, having the Horſes in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and their Riders armed: But the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthians</hi> advancing to the Suburbs and Gates of the Town in contempt of him; he went out againſt them with a body of men: As ſoon as they diſcovered him, they ſell to flight, and he having put them once to the rout, gave not over purſuing and ſlaying for ninety Furlongs together, and followed them up to the Walls of <hi>Olynthus.</hi> 'Twas reported, that <hi>Derdas</hi> killed eighty of their Cavalry in this

               <p>Some time after <hi>Teleutias</hi> moved to the Walls of <hi>Olynthus,</hi> deſtroying every Tree, and all the ground that was tilled. On the contrary, the <hi>Olynthian</hi> Horſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and marching gently, paſſed the River that ran by the Town, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſlowly towards the Enemy. <hi>Teleutias</hi> ſeeing them, was provoked by their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ordered <hi>Tlemonidas,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Targetiers, inſtantly to charge them with ſull ſpeed: When the <hi>Olynthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> diſcovered them running before the reſt of the Army, they faced about, and making a gentle Retreat repaſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> followed them very boldly, and as they retreated, the others purſued, and paſſed the River, after them.

Hereby it hapned,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58267:171"/>that as ſeveral indiſcreetly followed the Enemy too near the Wall, they came ſhort home; for they being ſhot at from the Turrets, were forced to retire in diſorder, and defend themſelves from the Arrows. The <hi>Olynthians</hi> being ſupported with a body of Targetiers charged with their Horſe; and at length the Heavy-arm'd men run out, and attacked the diſordered Troops of the Enemy. In this Skirmiſh, <hi>Teleutias</hi> died fighting; which when thoſe near him ſaw, they gave ground; nor did the reſt ſtand any longer, but were totally routed; ſome flying to <hi>Spartolus,</hi> others to <hi>Acanthus,</hi> ſome to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and moſt of them to <hi>Potidaea.</hi> Thus as they fled ſeveral ways diſperſedly; ſo the Enemy purſuing them in ſmall bodies, killed abundance, and thoſe too the ſlower of that great Army.</p>

He told them, If you'l do that, which if you had done before, all this trouble might have been prevented; that was to deliver up their Citadel; which when they refuſed, he marched into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and forthwith inveſted their City: Yet becauſe the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> talkt that above five thouſand men would be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>About this time <hi>Polybiades</hi> obliged the <hi>Olynthians</hi> to ſend to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> for Peace, they being reduced to great extremity by Famine, for that they could neither get in Proviſions by Land, nor import them by Sea.

               <p>There was one <hi>Phyllidas</hi> Secretary to <hi>Archias</hi> his Colleagues,<note place="margin">Nauſinicus Archon.</note> the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, a man thought capable to manage Buſineſs of the higheſt Concern; who coming to <hi>Athens</hi> about ſome Occaſions, fell into company with <hi>Mello</hi> an old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of his, and one of the Exiles there; and enquiring how <hi>Archias</hi> the chief Magiſtrate and <hi>Philip</hi> behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58267:175"/>in their tyranny, he found him more diſſatisfied with Affairs at home than himſelf. Whereupon they made a mutual Engagement, and agreed how all things ſhould be managed: Upon this <hi>Mello</hi> taking ſeven of the fitteſt men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Exiles without any Arms but their Swords, went with them into the Country near <hi>Thebes,</hi> and tarrying a day in a loneſom place, came to the Gates of the City at Night, pretending that they returned out of the Fields from their work: They were let into the Town, and lodged that Night and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing at one <hi>Charon</hi>'s houſe. In the mean while <hi>Phyllidas</hi> procured the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates all things neceſſary for the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing the Feaſt of <hi>Venus</hi> at the laying down of their Office, promiſing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a former Engagement, to procure them Women of the greateſt Quality, and the moſt celebrated Beauties in <hi>Thebes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They being ſuch kind of Blades, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to divert themſelves very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly that Night: After Supper, when <hi>Phyllidas</hi> had warm'd them pretty well with Wine, they ordered him to bring in the Miſſes; accordingly he went out, and fetched in <hi>Mello,</hi> and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58267:176"/>dreſſing three of the mlike Ladies, and the reſt like their Women, and carried them into the Treaſury. Then he went in, and acquainted <hi>Archias</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that the women refuſed to enter, whilſt any of their Attendants remained in the Room: Thereupon they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all inſtantly to withdraw; <hi>Phyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas</hi> gave them Wine, and conveyed them into one of the Officers houſes. Then he introduced the Miſſes, and placed them each by their Gallants; the fign being, that as ſoon as they were ſeated, and they began to ruffle them, they ſhould ſtab them. Some report they were killed after this manner; others report, that <hi>Mello</hi> and his Complices coming in where they were at a Feaſt, diſpatched them.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Phyllidas</hi> taking three of his Companions, went to <hi>Leontiades</hi>'s houſe, and knockt at the Door, ſaying, he had a Meſſage to him from the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. <hi>Leontiades</hi> was laid down after Supper to repoſe himſelf, and his Wife ſate by him Spinning: he ſuppoſing <hi>Phyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas</hi> to be an honeſt man, bid him and his Company come in; they entring, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, frighted her, and commanding her to be ſilent, ordered the Doors to be ſhut, threatning if they found them open,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58267:176"/>to kill every one in the houſe. When <hi>Phyllidas</hi> had done this, he took two of the men and went to the Priſon, telling the Goaler that he brought one from the chief Magiſtrate to be taken into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. As ſoon as he opened the Doors, they killed him immediately, and turning all the Priſoners looſe, gave them the Arms they took out of the <hi>Portico,</hi> and leading them up to the <hi>Ampheum,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſtand. Soon after they made Proclamation by a Cryer, That all the Horſe and heavy-armed men ſhould appear in Arms, becauſe the Tyrants were ſlain; but the Citizens giving no credit to it that Night, remained quiet; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certified of it in the Morning, the heavy-arm'd men and Horſe came out with their Arms immediately.</p>
               <p>The Exiles that return'd from baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent the Horſe to the two <hi>Athenian</hi> Generals on the Frontiers,<note place="margin">The Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> retaken</note> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the buſineſs they came for. The Governour in the Citadel hearing of the Proclamation made the Night before, ſent immediately to <hi>Plataeae,</hi> and <hi>Theſpiae</hi> for aſſiſtance: but the <hi>Theban</hi> Horſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intelligence that the <hi>Plataeans</hi> were upon their march, went out to meet them, and killed twenty. After this action, when
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58267:177"/>they returned to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> arrived from the Frontiers, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Citadel. They in the Place knowing themſelves to be weak, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courage of the Aſſailants, there being Proclamation made of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for thoſe that mounted the Wall firſt, were terrified, and offered to quit the Place, if they might depart with their Arms upon ſafe Conduct. The <hi>Thebans</hi> willingly granted them their Conditions, and confirming the Articles by Oath, they let them go; yet they killed ſuch of their Enemies as they found amongſt them, though the <hi>Athenians</hi> who came in to the Aſſiſtance of the Conſpirators from the Frontiers concealed ſome: nay, the <hi>Thebans</hi> took even the children of ſuch as had any, and cruelly put them to death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of this, put the Governour that ſurrendred the Citadel to death, for not holding out till Succors came, and decreed to ſend an Army againſt the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</hi> But <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> pleading that he was forty years above man's Eſtate, proved that as others of that Age were not obliged to go to any Forreign War, ſo there was the ſame Law for a King, and by this he excuſed himſelf from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58267:177"/>Yet this was not the reaſon why he ſtaid at home, but becauſe he knew very well, that if he undertook that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, the People would ſay, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the State in a War, that he might give the Tyrants aſſiſtance. So he let them take their own meaſures.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ephori</hi> upon Advice of thoſe that were baniſhed after the Maſſacre at <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſent out <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> in a very ſharp Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that being the firſt time he was General. He took his march by the way of <hi>Plataeae,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chabrius</hi> kept the Paſs by <hi>Elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therae</hi> with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Targetiers. Theſe Targetiers advancing before the reſt, met with thoſe that were let out of Priſon, on a Hill, being about an hundred and fifty, and cut them all in pieces, except ſome few that might eſcape by chance. From that Place <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> paſſed on to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeae,</hi> a Town at this time in Amity with the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Afterwards he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Theſpiae,</hi> and moving from thence to <hi>Cynocephalae,</hi> a Town belonging to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> he encamped there, where he ſtayd ſixteen days, and then returned back to <hi>Theſpiae,</hi> leaving <hi>Sphodrias</hi> there with the third part of the Confederates, and gave him what Money he had brought with him from home, ordering

               <p>Whilſt <hi>Sphodrias</hi> was about this, <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> returned home with his Forces the way that leads through <hi>Creuſis,</hi> being uncertain whether they ſhould have War or Peace with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> yet though he led his Army through their Country, he departed without doing much Miſchief. In his Retreat there hap'ned an unlucky Wind, which ſome divined did prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that which was to come. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſeveral other effects of its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, at that time when <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> marched with the Army out of <hi>Creuſis,</hi> over the Mountains that reach to the Sea, it bore ſeveral Aſſes with their Packs down the precipice, and carried many Arms into the Sea: ſo that ſeveral being not able to march with their Arms, left them up and down on the top of the Mountains, inverting their Shields, and fillng them with Stones. That Night they ſupped on what they could get at <hi>Aegosthena,</hi> a Town in the Countrey of <hi>Megara.</hi> The Day following they went, and ſetched their Arms: and <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> disbanded them, all departing home.</p>

                  <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Ambaſſadors at <hi>Athens</hi> were entertained
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58267:179"/>by <hi>Callias</hi> their Publick Hoſt, but when this News came, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſeized them, and committed them to ſafe Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuſpecting them to be concerned in this Conſpiracy. The Ambaſſadors being amazed at it, made their Defence, ſaying, they would ne'r have been ſuch Fools, if they had known the <hi>Piraeus</hi> was to have been ſeized, as to have remained in the City under their Power, nor with a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Hoſt, where they might ſo eaſily be found out, adding that it would appear the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> themſelves knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, and that they would ſoon hear that the Republick would puniſh <hi>Sphodrias.</hi> Thus they having purged themſelves, were diſcharged.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ephori</hi> recalling <hi>Sphodrias,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached him of High Treaſon, and he being frighted, made no appearance, yet was acquitted. Many thought theſe Proceedings of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were unjuſt. The reaſon hereof was this; <hi>Sphodrias</hi> had a Son named <hi>Cleonymus,</hi> newly come to man's Eſtate, being the moſt beautiful and renowned of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, whom <hi>Archidamus Ageſilaus</hi>'s Son intirely loved. <hi>Cleombrotus</hi>'s Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very intimate with <hi>Sphodrias,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to acquit him, but becauſe he had
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58267:179"/>committed ſo hainous a crime, they feared as well <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and his Party, as thoſe that were indifferent. A while after <hi>Sphodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> ſaid to <hi>Cleonymus,</hi> Son you may ſave your Father's Life, by intreating <hi>Archidamus</hi> to prevail with his Father, to be favourable to me in my Trial. He hearing him ſay ſo, put on confidence, and going to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamus</hi> begged of him to bring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off. <hi>Archidamus</hi> ſeeing <hi>Cleonymus</hi> weep, wept too, and after he had heard his Petition, ſaid to him, you know <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus,</hi> I am not able to look my Father in the face, but when I would carry any thing in the City, I make uſe rather of any than him. Yet ſince you command me, aſſure your ſelf, I'll uſe my utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſerve you herein.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Archidamus</hi> went home from the Publick Eating-place, and repoſed himſelf; in the Morning as ſoon as he was up, he took care to obſerve his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's walking abroad, and when he ſaw him go forth, if there were any of the <hi>Spartans</hi> by, he let them diſcourſe with his Father, and if there were any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Servants that deſired to make their Addreſſes, he gave way for them too.</p>
               <p>At length as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was returning home from the <hi>Eurotas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The River on which <hi>Sparta</hi> ſtands.</note> 
                  <hi>Archidamus</hi> went away, and came not near his Father, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58267:180"/>the next day he did ſo again. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſuſpecting for what he went after him ſo, askt him no Queſtions, but let him go his way. In the mean time <hi>Archidamus,</hi> you may be ſure, had a great deſire to ſee <hi>Cleonymus,</hi> but to go to him before he had diſcourſed his Father, he could not. Then <hi>Sphodrias</hi>'s Friends ſeeing <hi>Archidamus</hi> did not come to his Houſe, ſo often as he was wont, were at their Wits end, leſt <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> ſhould have given him a rebuff. At laſt <hi>Archidamus</hi> ventured to go, and thus accoſted him. Father! <hi>Cleonymus</hi> deſired of me to beg of you, that you would ſave his Fathers Life, and I make it my requeſt that it may be granted. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, I forgive you, but I don't ſee how I ſhall get my own pardon from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, for not condemning one that has taken Bribes to the prejudice of his Countrey. At that time he replied nothing again, being convinced by the Juſtice <hi>of what his Father ſaid,</hi> but went his way. Yet afterwards, whether he took notice of it by his own motion, or that it was hinted to him by ſome body elſe, he went to him, and ſaid Father! I know that if <hi>Sphodrias</hi> had not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, you would have acquitted him for Innocencie's ſake, and if he has, pardon him for mine. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> made him this
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58267:180"/>Anſwer, if it be conſiſtent with my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, it ſhall be ſo; which when he heard, he went away with ſmall hopes.</p>
               <p>About that time one of <hi>Sphodrias</hi>'s Friends diſcourſing with <hi>Etymocles,</hi> ſaid, I believe all you that are of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s Party will be for putting <hi>Sphodrias</hi> to death. <hi>Etymocles</hi> replied, why ſhould we not follow <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s Opinion, ſeeing he tells every one he diſcourſes about it, that it is impoſſible to bring him off. Yet it would be hard for him to be put to death in the Flower of his Age, who has behaved himſelf ſo well, when a Child, a Youth, and a Man grown: for <hi>Sparta</hi> wants ſuch Soldiers. He hearing this, told it <hi>Cleonymus,</hi> who being pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with went directly to <hi>Archidamus,</hi> ſaying, Now, I know you have a reſpect for me, and I would have you reſt ſatisfied, that my endeavours ſhall be, ſo as your love mayn't be miſplaced. Nor was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in him, for he behaved himſelf ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably in his Countrey, as long as he lived, and fought at <hi>Leuctra</hi> under Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Dino,</hi> before the King, where char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the formoſt of the Battel he fell in the midſt of the Enemy, greatly afflicting <hi>Archidamus.</hi> Nor was he, according to his Promiſe, a Diſhonour, but a Credit to him.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:58267:181"/>
               <p>After this manner <hi>Sphodrias</hi> got off: whereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> that favoured the Intereſt of the <hi>Boeotian</hi> Faction, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the People, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were ſo far from puniſhing <hi>Sphodrias,</hi> that they commended him for plotting againſt <hi>Athens.</hi> Upon that the <hi>Athenians</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, made Gates to the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> built Ships, and vigorouſly aſſiſted the <hi>Boeotians.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> decreed that an Army ſhould be ſent againſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and deſired <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to take the Command of it, eſteeming him one of better Conduct than <hi>Cleombrotus.</hi> He told them, that he would comply with the pleaſure of the State, what ever it was; and ſo prepared for his march. But when he underſtood that it would be no eaſie matter to enter the <hi>Thebans</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, unleſs he was firſt poſſeſt of <hi>Cithae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and being advertiſed that the <hi>Cleto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were at War with the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> and had entertained Mercenary Troops in their Service, he treated with them to lend him thoſe Forces, in caſe he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for them. After he had obtained an auſpicious Sacrifice for his Expedition, he ſent, before he arrived with his Army at <hi>Tegea,</hi> to the General of the Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſerved under the <hi>Cletorians,</hi> and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58267:181"/>gave them a Months pay, commanding them to go, and poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> and ordered the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> to forbear Hoſtilities, threatning alſo, that if any City ſhould make War during the time of this Expedition, he would perſuant to the Decree of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, fall immediately upon them.</p>
               <p>After he had paſſed <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Theſpiae;</hi> and parting from thence with his Army, he marched into the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> Countrey, and finding the Plain and beſt Parts of it entrenched, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Paliſadoes, he encamped in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places, and after Dinner ſent out Parties to burn, and deſtroy the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that lay before his Works. For whereſoever <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> marched, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appeared upon the Defenſive Part within their Trenches. But when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Camp, the <hi>Theban</hi> Horſe lying under a Covert, ſallied out of the Avenews, about the time the Targetiers were getting their Supper ready, and preparing for it, the Horſe being partly mounted and diſmounted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> underſtanding that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my uſed to appear in the Field after it was Noon, ſacrificed by break of Day, and marching with diligence, entred their Trenches through a Place, that was not well guarded, waſting and deſtroying all to the Gates of <hi>Thebes.</hi> After this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he retired to <hi>Theſpiae,</hi> and walled the Town, appointing <hi>Phoebidas</hi> Governour of the Place; and marching back again to <hi>Megara,</hi> disbanded the Auxiliaries, and returned home with his <hi>Spartans.</hi> From that time <hi>Phoebidas</hi> ſent out Foragers to ruin, and deſtroy the Countrey about <hi>Thebes,</hi> who waſted it with their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Depredations.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58267:182"/>
                  <hi>Phoebidas</hi> obſerved them, and obliged them to keep together in a cloſe Body. So that the <hi>Thebans</hi> being weary of their invaſion, haſtened their Retreat out of the Countrey: the <hi>Muletiers</hi> alſo threw away the Corn they carried, and drave their Mules home, ſo great a Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the Army in! Then <hi>Phoebidas</hi> taking the Targetiers along with him, commanded the Heavy-armed men to follow, and preſſed the Enemy very hard, hoping to give them a total Defeat. For he led on very boldly, encouraging his men to ſet ſeriouſly to their Work, and the <hi>Theſpian</hi> Heavy-armed men to follow. The <hi>Theban</hi> Cavalry getting together in a Body, retired to a Foreſt that could not be paſſed through, and there they turned upon the Enemy, becauſe there was no way to retreat. Whereupon the formoſt of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Targetiers being few in number, and ſtruck with a terror, fell to flight: Which the <hi>Theban</hi> Horſe ſeeing, they were encouraged to fall upon thoſe that fled, and ſoon after <hi>Phoebidas</hi> with two or three more, that fought by him were ſlain: Whereupon all the Mercenaries fled. When they came in their purſuit to the Heavy-armed men of the <hi>Theſpians,</hi> theſe who before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to yield to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> turned their
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58267:183"/>backs, though purſued by none, becauſe it was late in the Evening, and though but few of them were ſlain, yet they ſtopped not, till they had a Wall between them, and their Enemy.</p>
               <p>By this Action the <hi>Theban</hi> Affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered new Life again; ſo that they made War upon the <hi>Theſpians,</hi> and other Neighbouring Cities, cauſing the People to remove from theſe Places to <hi>Thebes,</hi> there being in thoſe Towns the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as in that City, by which the Friends of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there. After <hi>Phaebidas</hi> was ſlain, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent a Colonel with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment by Sea, to put into the Gariſon at <hi>Theſpiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Spring the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent an Army againſt <hi>Thebes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Olymp. <hi>101.</hi> Chariander Archon.</note> and intreated <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to command it. He took the ſame Meaſures in this Expedition, as in the other, ſending before he had an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious Sacrifice to the Colonel at <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piae,</hi> to poſſeſs himſelf of the Paſs over <hi>Cithaeron,</hi> and keep it till he himſelf ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived thither. When <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> paſſed this Hill, and came to <hi>Plataeae,</hi> he made as if he would firſt march to <hi>Theſpiae,</hi> ſending thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ordering Proviſions to be got ready, and the Deputies to expect him there. The Day following <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58267:183"/>by break of Day, and reaching <hi>Erythroe</hi> performed two days march in one, and paſſed the Trench at <hi>Scolum,</hi> before the <hi>Thebans</hi> came from the Guard of that Poſt, where he entred at firſt. Having performed this, he deſtroyed the <hi>Thebans</hi> Countrey, as far as that of <hi>Tana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi> (which hitherto was defended by <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patadorus,</hi> and his men the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Allies) and retreated to the left of the Town. The <hi>Thebans</hi> coming upon him, drew up in <hi>Batallia</hi> at a Place called the Old Woman's Breaſt, having ſecured their Rear with a Ditch and <hi>Paliſado,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they might eaſily hazard a Battle there, becauſe the Place was very narrow, and not eaſily acceſſible. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſeeing this, did not attack them, but marched a contrary way towards <hi>Thebes:</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> being in pain for their City, becauſe it was naked, left the place where they were drawn up, and haſtned thither with diligence, by the way that leads to <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae,</hi> that being the ſecureſt.</p>
               <p>This was eſteemed a neat Stratagem; for <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> by retiring a good diſtance from the Enemy, obliged them alſo to retreat full ſpeed: beſides the Colonels flanked them with ſome Regiments as they paſſed by. On the other hand the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58267:184"/>
                  <hi>Thebans</hi> darted their Javelins from the Hill; ſo that <hi>Alipetus</hi> one of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels was killed therewith. Yet the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> were beaten from this Hill, and the <hi>Sciritae</hi> aſcending with a Party of Horſe, cut off ſome of their Rear as they paſſed by towards <hi>Thebes.</hi> When the <hi>Thebans</hi> were advanced near the Walls, they faced about, which the <hi>Sciritae</hi> ſeeing, retired with diligence, and though not one of them was loſt, yet the <hi>Thebans</hi> erected a Trophy, becauſe the Enemy retreated from the Place to which they had firſt aſcended.</p>
               <p>The Seaſon being advanced, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> parted thence, and encamped in a Place where he diſcovered the Enemy firſt drawn up, and the next Day decamped, marching the way that leads to <hi>Theſpiae.</hi> The Mercenary Targetiers of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> following them very boldly, called to <hi>Chabrias</hi> to keep up cloſe; the <hi>Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Horſe alſo, who according to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſerved under the <hi>Thebans,</hi> facing about, purſued them to the riſe of an Hill, and killed a great many, for the Hill being eaſie to be rode up, the Horſe made the Foot Priſoners on the Aſcent. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> came to <hi>Theſpiae,</hi> and found the People divided, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi>

From thence he returned over <hi>Cithoeron,</hi> the way that goes to <hi>Megara,</hi> and there having disbanded the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, marched home with the Troops of his own Countreymen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> being hard preſſed with ſcarcity of Proviſions at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had reaped no Corn for two years together, manned two Gallies, and ſent ten Talents to be expended in Corn at <hi>Pagaſae.</hi>

                  <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was confined to his Bed, for when he marcht with his Army out of the <hi>Thebans</hi> Countrey to <hi>Megara,</hi> as he was going out of <hi>Venus</hi>'s Temple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Senate-houſe; he broke a Vein ſomewhere or other in his Body, and the Blood flowed out from thence into the ſound Leg, then the calf ſwelling, and the pains growing intollerable, a <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Doctor opened a Vein by the Ankle. Yet the blood ran Day and Night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and did not ſtop, do what they could, till he ſwounded, and then it ſtanched. From hence he was carried to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where he lay ſick the reſt of the Summer, and the Winter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Early in the Spring the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent out another Army,<note place="margin">Socratides Archon.</note> and gave the Command thereof to <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> who marched with his Forces to <hi>Cithaeron:</hi> the Targetiers went before to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Places that lay above the Road; but a Party of <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Thebans</hi> having taken the Hill before them, they let them aſcend, and having gotten them within their power, roſe up,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58267:185"/>purſued, and killed near forty of them. After this Action <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> thinking it impoſſible to paſs into the <hi>Thebans</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey marched back again with his Army, and disbanded them.</p>
               <p>At that time the Confederates being aſſembled at <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> muttered that they were conſumed by the War, through the negligence of their Generals, that they could man out a much ſtronger Fleet, than the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and could ſtarve their City, that they could tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an Army in this Fleet into the Countrey of <hi>Thebes,</hi> either at <hi>Phocis,</hi> or <hi>Creuſis.</hi> Hereupon they fitted out ſixty Sail, and made <hi>Pollis</hi> Admiral.

               <p>THE Affairs of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſtood thus. The <hi>Thebans</hi> having ſubdued the Towns of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> carried the War into <hi>Phocis:</hi> whereupon the <hi>Phoceans</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to let them know, that if they were not ſuccoured, they muſt neceſſarily fall into the hands of the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Upon this Meſſage they ſent <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> their King with four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and a Detachment of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates into <hi>Phocis.</hi> Much about this time, <hi>Polydamas</hi> the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> came out of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> being eſteemed in the other Parts thereof, a Perſon of Honour and Integrity, and in his own City was reputed one of that Probity, that the <hi>Pharſalians</hi> in time of Sedition committed the Citadel to his care, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to receive the Revenues aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law to be expended on the<note n="*" place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were at the charge of the Publick for the moſt part, and <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58267:188"/>according to the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Mode a Lover of Hoſpitality and Magnificence. When he arrived at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> he made this Oration before the Senate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis but reaſonable</hi> (My Lords of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon</hi>) <hi>ſeeing I and all my Anceſtors have been your Publick Hoſts and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Polyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>that I ſhould make my Applications to you in my Straits; and, when any thing oppoſes your Intereſt in</hi> Theſſaly, <hi>that I ſhould inform you thereof. I make no queſtion but you have heard of</hi> Jaſon, <hi>a man of great Fame, and one that can bring a conſiderable Army into the Field. He made a Truce, and coming to me, ſpake after this manner.</hi> Polydamas! <hi>I have already reduced the moſt powerful Cities of</hi> Theſſaly; <hi>and thoſe I have conquered though aſſisted by your Arms. Let this therefore be a convincing Argument to you; that I can poſſeſs my ſelf of your City</hi> Pharſalus <hi>maugre all the oppoſition you can make. You know that I have ſix thouſand Mercenaries, which in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility no City can withſtand, and I can draw as great a Body out of the Gariſons. On the other hand the Forces of the Cities are ſuch as are ſuperannuated, or not yet grown up, being raw, and undiſciplined men: but I entertain none in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58267:189"/>that can't endure the hardſhips of War as well as my ſelf. I'll give you a very true Account how Affairs ſtand. This</hi> Jaſon <hi>is of a robuſt Body, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Induſtry; he exerciſes his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers every day, training them in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery Ground, and in his Marches, and thoſe Mercenaries he finds effeminate, he caſhiers. But ſuch as he ſees behave themſelves in time of Action with Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Reſolution, he honours with the pay of two, three, nay ſometimes four men, together with other Rewards, as the Cure of their Distempers, and decent Burial. So that all Mercenaries, who ſerve under him, know, that their valour procures them an honourable, and plentiful Livelihood. He informed me further, though I was not ignorant of it before, that the</hi> Maraci, Dolopes, <hi>and</hi> Alcetas <hi>the Governour of</hi> Epirus <hi>were already ſubdued. What then need I fear,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but that I may think my ſelf able to maſter you with eaſe? But perhaps ſome that don't know me will ſay, why do you delay? why don't you immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately makeWar againſt the</hi> Pharſalians? <hi>my reaſon is, becauſe I think it far better to engage them by a fair compliance than open force; for if I uſe conſtraint, you will on the one hand make it your Buſineſs to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58267:189"/>create me what trouble you can, and I on the other to diminiſh your Power as far as I am able, But if you will be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to joyn me, we ſhall be a mighty rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement to each other. I underſtand</hi> Polydamas, <hi>that the eyes of all your Countrey are ſixt upon you, and if you will bring over the People to my Intereſt, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to make you the greateſt man, next my ſelf, throughout all</hi> Greece. <hi>Yet hear what thoſe Affairs are, that I'll give you the adminiſtration of next under my ſelf, and credit me no farther, than your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will give you leave. 'Tis apparent, that with the Acceſſion of</hi> Pharſalus, <hi>and thoſe Towns you are poſſeſſed of, I could with eaſe be made Captain General of the</hi> Theſſalians; <hi>and if</hi> Theſſaly <hi>were under ſuch a Commander, we could raiſe ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and above ten thouſand Heavy-armed men; whoſe Stature and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity whilſt I conſider, I think if they were well diſciplined, they would be the braveſt men throughout the World. For</hi> Theſſaly <hi>being a large Countrey, all the Nations round about it, would be reduced, if once a Captain General was conſtituted. Moſt of our Neighbours are expert in throwing the Lance, ſo that in probability they may be too ſtrong for us in Targeties: yet the</hi> Boeotians, <hi>and the reſt who are engaged in
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58267:190"/>the War againſt the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>are my Allies; and will all follow me, if I would but deliver them from the</hi> Spartan <hi>Yoke. I am ſenſible too, that the</hi> Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>are very zealous to make an Alliance with us; but I have no deſign to joyn them, becauſe I think 'tis eaſier to obtain the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the Sea, than the Empire of the Land. Yet I would have you conſider</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>whether I ſpeak reaſon or no. For we, being poſſeſt of</hi> Macedon, <hi>from whence the</hi> Athenians <hi>have their Timber, ſhall be able to build a ſtronger Fleet than they: whether can they equip a Fleet ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or we, who have ſo great a number of lusty Slaves? Who are better able to maintain Seamen, we that have ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Corn, as to export, or they who have not ſufficient for themſelves unleſs they buy? Perhaps too, we have more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Money, being we depend not on little tributary Iſlands, but receive our Taxes from the Nations on the Continent. When</hi> Theſſaly <hi>is under a Captain General all the adjacent Countries ſhall pay us Tribute; the King of</hi> Perſia <hi>too who is the richeſt man on Earth, does not raiſe his Tribute on the Iſles, but Main-land, and might be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with leſs difficulty than</hi> Greece, <hi>for all the men there (one excepted) have more mind to be Slaves, than to be Soldiers. I
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58267:190"/>know too what kind of Forces they were who marcht with</hi> Cyrus, <hi>and</hi> Ageſilaus, <hi>that brought the King of</hi> Perſia <hi>to the laſt extremity. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this his Diſcourſe, I told him he ſpoke ſeveral things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be ſeriouſly conſidered. But,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I don't understand why we ſhould quit the</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>Intereſt, ſeeing we can lay nothing to their charge. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me, adding, that ſince I was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Honour, he was the more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make an Alliance with me, and gave me liberty to come and acquaint your how Affairs ſtood, and that he is reſolved to fall upon us</hi> Pharſalians, <hi>if we don't ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to him. He bid me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demand aſſiſtance of you, and,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if you can prevail with them to ſend a ſufficient force againſt me, I ſhall then take what advantage the Fortune of War puts into my hands. But if you think they will not ſupply you with an Army ſtrong enough, you will not eſcape the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your Countreymen, who have ſo great a veneration for you, and amongſt whom you bear the greateſt ſway. This is my Errand to you, and I have related both what I ſaw my ſelf, and heard from him. I ſuppoſe,</hi> My Lords, <hi>that if you ſend ſuch Forces as I and the reſt of</hi> Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58267:191"/>
                  <hi>ſhall think ſufficient to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Jaſon; <hi>that the other Cities will revolt: For all are jealous of the growth of this mans power;-and if you think your Half-ſlaves, undiſciplin'd men, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of no Conduct will ſerve; I adviſe you rather to be quiet: For aſſure your ſelves, you have a mighty power, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Leader for to ſtruggle with; Who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Stratagem, Surprize, or Force, rarely miſſes of his Enterprize. The Day and Night are all one to him, and when Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition is required, he can Eat and March at the ſame time; thinking 'tis then only time to Repoſe, when he is arrived whither he intended, and has accompliſhed what he deſigned. He has alſo inured his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the ſame hardſhip, understanding how to gratifie the deſires of his men, when they have adventured hard, and to ſuit his Rewards to their Fancies: So that thoſe who ſerve under him, have learnt the reſult of their Toils to be certain Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pleaſure. And this advantage he has, that never any man was more abſtemious from bodily pleaſures, being never diverted by them from diſpatching his buſineſs: 'Tis your concern therefore to conſider of theſe things, and to let me know both what you can, and what you intend to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:58267:191"/>
               <p>Thus he ſpake; the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Anſwer, and taking into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the next day, and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing how many Regiments they had abroad, and how many Gallies to fight the <hi>Athenians</hi> with; as alſo what Forces they had to carry on the War againſt the Borderers, return'd him this Anſwer; That at preſent they were not in a condition to ſend him ſufficient Succours, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to go home, and put his own Affairs, and thoſe of the City in the beſt poſture he could: He commended the plain dealing of the Republick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he went to <hi>Jaſon,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him not to oblige him to deliver up the City of <hi>Pharſalus,</hi> but permit him to keep it for them that had committed it to his care, and gave his Children for Hoſtages, promiſing to bring over the City by a free Conſent, and make him Captain-General: Whereupon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Hoſtages being exchanged, the <hi>Pharſalians</hi> obtained Peace, and <hi>Jaſon</hi> by an univerſal conſent, was declared Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General of the <hi>Theſſalians.</hi> After he was choſen, he appointed what <hi>Quotas</hi> of Horſe and heavy-armed men, each City ſhould furniſh, having above eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:58267:192"/>Horſe together with the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; of heavy-armed men, no leſs than twenty thouſand, and Targetiers enough to fight any Army whatſoever. It would be too tedious a piece of work to reckon up, what a number of conſiderabe Cities <hi>were ſubject to him:</hi> He ordered all the Neighbouring-people to pay the ſame Tribute they did in <hi>Scopas</hi>'s time, and thus things ſtood on that ſide.</p>
               <p>Now I leave <hi>Jaſon</hi>'s Affairs, and return to the place, where I made my Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates aſſembling in <hi>Phocis,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> retired into their own Territories, and guarded the Paſſes. The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Thebans,</hi> though raiſed by them, contribute no Ship-money; that they themſelves were fleeced with Taxes, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Depredations from the <hi>Aegineans,</hi> and maintained Gariſons, were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to bring the War to a concluſion, and ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make a Peace. Immediately two of the Ambaſſadors ſetting ſail from thence by order of the Republick, commanded <hi>Yimotheus</hi> to return home with the Fleet, becauſe peace was made. In his return he carried the Exiles of <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> and put them a-ſhore in their own Country:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:58267:192"/>Thereupon the <hi>Zacynthians</hi> ſent to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> and acquainted them with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they had ſuffered from <hi>Timotheus;</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſuppoſing the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had broken the Peace by this action, fitted out another Fleet forthwith, getting together ſixty Sail,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>From</hi> Lacedemon, Corinth, Leucas, Ambracia, Elis, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthus, Achaia, Epidaurus, Troezen, Hermione, <hi>and the</hi> Halieans.</note> and appointed <hi>Mna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi> Admiral, giving him Commiſſion amongſt other things, to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and to guard the Seas.</p>
               <p>They ſent alſo to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> to let him know that it was his Concern not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Corcyra</hi> to remain in the hands of the <hi>Athenians. Mnaſippus</hi> having aſſembled his Fleet, went againſt <hi>Corcyra</hi> with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Mercenaries, beſides thoſe from <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> There he making a Deſcent, took the Iſland, and burnt the Country which was neatly Cultivated and Planted, having ſtately Houſes and Wine-Cellars in ſeveral places: Inſomuch, they report the Souldiers grew ſo dainty, that they would drink none but<note n="†" place="margin">This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſo much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Ancients, was made of new Wine, and a mixture of Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: their Wines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were perfumed with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Roſes, and other fragrant Flowers. <hi>Athen. lib.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Aromatick</hi>-Wine. A great many Priſoners and Cattel were alſo taken in the Country: After that <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> encamped on a Hill five Furlongs diſtant from the City in the Front of the Iſland, that ſo he might cut off any Forces which entred the Iſland on
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58267:193"/>that ſide: On the other he lay with the Fleet, ſuppoſing he could diſcover any Ships that were going thither, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from landing. Moreover, he rode in the Port, and blockt up the City when he was not hindred by ſtorms. The <hi>Corcyreans</hi> ſeeing they could get nothing out of the Country, becauſe it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Enemy, and that nothing could be imported by Sea, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred there, became greatly diſtreſſed; and ſent to deſire Succours of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> acquainting them that the taking <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra</hi> would be both a great loſs to them, and an acceſſion of ſtrength to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: For no City furniſhed more Money or Ships than theirs, excepting <hi>Athens;</hi> Beſides <hi>Corcyra</hi> lay commodiouſly for the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the places that belonged to it; as alſo opportunely for the infeſting <hi>Laconia,</hi> but moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly for the oppoſite Continent, and the Paſſage out of <hi>Sicily</hi> into <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> hearing this, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a matter of very great Importance, ſent <hi>Steſicles</hi> Commander in Chief, with about ſix hundred <hi>Targetiers,</hi> requeſting <hi>Alcetas</hi> to tranſport them: Accordingly he landed them at a certain place in the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58267:193"/>Iſland by Night, and ſo they got into the City. Beſides, they equipped ſixty Sail of Ships, and appointed <hi>Timotheus</hi> Admiral, who went to the Iſlands, &amp; endeavoured to make up their Complement there, becauſe he could not fit them out at <hi>Athens;</hi> accounting it a matter of no ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go with Precipitation againſt a Fleet that was already united. The <hi>Athenians</hi> concluding he trifled and waſted the time of Action, forgave him not, but put him out of Commiſſion, and choſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicrates</hi> in his room; who in a very ſmall time fitted out a Fleet with great diligence, obliging thoſe that were bound to ſet out Gallies to equip them, taking the <hi>Paralus</hi> and <hi>Salaminia, which in a more ſpecial manner attended the Service of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> and what Ships ſoever he met with on the Coaſt of <hi>Attica,</hi> telling them that if things ſucceeded well in <hi>Corcyra,</hi> he would ſend ſeveral back again, and got together a Fleet of about ſeventy Sail.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> were ſo diſtreſſed with Famine, that <hi>Mna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi> by reaſon of the numbers of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters, declared by Proclamation, That all ſuch ſhould be ſold for Slaves: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs when ſome deſerted for all that, he whipt them, and ſent them back again.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:58267:194"/>On the contrary, the Beſieged would not receive their Slaves into the Town, ſo that they died without the Walls. When <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> ſaw this, he thought he was Cock-ſure of the Town, and began to Treat the <hi>Mercenaries</hi> after a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, abridging ſome of their whole Pay, and was two Months in Arrears to thoſe which he paid. Nor did he this for want of Money, as was reported; for it being a Sea-Expedition, ſeveral Cities had ſent Money in lieu of Men. In the mean while, the Beſieged diſcovering from the Towers the Watches not ſo carefully kept as before, and the Souldiers ſtragling up and down the Country, ſallied out, took ſome, and killed others. <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> having notice hereof, not only arm'd himſelf, but went out with his heavy-arm'd men to their Relief, ordering the Commanders and Captains to lead out their <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> and when ſome of them made anſwer, It was not eaſie for him to contain the Souldiers in their Duty, who had not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with Neceſſaries, he ſtruck one with his Truncheon, and another with the Javelin of his Lance: And thus they marched out ſhrewdly againſt their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, hating their General; <hi>a thing no ways expedient in time of Action.</hi> After
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58267:194"/>he had drawn them up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> he routed thoſe that were poſted by the Gates, and purſued them, but they get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting near the Walls, and facing about, threw their Javelins, and darted their Lances from off the Monuments: At the ſame time, more ſallied out at the other Gates, and fell pell-mell upon his Rear. The men being marſhalled Eight in Front, and apprehending that part of the <hi>Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be weak, endeavoured to face about: but as they began to retreat, the Enemy attacked them, as if they had actually fled, ſo that they could face no more; and then thoſe next the Rear were routed. By this time <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> was not able to ſuccor them that were preſſed, becauſe the Enemy lay hard upon him in the Front, and hoſe about him grew ſtill fewer and fewer. At laſt the Enemy gave a furious Charge, and attacked <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> his Squadron, being already reduced to a ſmall number, which the heavy-arm'd men ſeeing, came on, and killing <hi>Mnaſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> purſued with all their Forces, and had taken the Camp, and Trench, but that diſcovering the Sutiers Servants, and Slaves, they took them to be men effective, and retired.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corcyreans</hi> erected a Trophy, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58267:195"/>reſtored the Dead upon Truce. Hereupon they in the Town gathered ſtrength, and the Beſiegers were wholly diſheartned, there being news that <hi>Iphicrates</hi> was as good as arrived, and the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> were Equipping their Fleet; Upon that, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permenes, Mnaſippus</hi> his Vice-Admiral, fitted out all the Ships that were there, and ſailing about to the Camp, put the Slaves and Money on board all the ſmall Veſſels, and ſent them away, defending the Camp himſelf with the Seamen, and other Souldiers that had eſcaped the Battel; who having very great Apprehenſions leſt they ſhould be ſurprized by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> went on board the Gallies in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and ſetting Sail, arrived ſafe at <hi>Leucas,</hi> leaving behind them a great quantity of Corn and Wine, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of Slaves and ſick men. When <hi>Iphicrates</hi> ſet Sail, he immediately made ready for an engagement, leaving his main Sails as though he were going to fight, &amp; made little uſe of his ſmall Veſſels though it was a fair Gale, but kept on his courſe with rowing, whereby he exerciſed the mens bodies more, and made the Ships Sail better: For ſeveral times in thoſe places, where the Fleet were to Dine or Sup, he ſtood out to Sea, and then tacking,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58267:195"/>lay with the Stems of the Gallies towards the Shore, commanding them when the ſign was given, to ſtrive who ſhould land firſt, becauſe they that did, were by way of Reward ſerved firſt with Water, or any thing elſe they wanted, and had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of dining firſt.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, it was a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the Tardy to be deprived of all thoſe Advantages, and be obliged to come on board when the ſign was made; for thoſe that got firſt aſhore did every thing at their leiſure, but thoſe that came laſt, did all in an hurry. When <hi>Iphicrates</hi> dined in the Enemies Country, he ſet Centinels, as the cuſtom is at Land, and haled up his Maſts, ſetting the men to ſpy from them; ſo that they looking from an Eminence, ſaw a great deal further than they could upon a Level. When he had Supped and Repoſed, he made no Fires in the Camp, but made Lights before it, that the Enemy might not approach undiſcovered: Oftentimes when he ſupped in a Calm, he put to Sea, and if it were a Gale, the Seamen reſted, and the Fleet kept on their courſe; if they were obliged to row, he refreſhed them by turns; and in their courſe by Day, he ſometimes drew up the Fleet in a Line,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58267:196"/>and other whiles in a Body: So that they ſuppoſing as they ſailed, that they went into a Sea poſſeſſed by the Enemies, had all things in readineſs for an Engagement. And becauſe <hi>Iphicrates</hi> did only that which was juſt neceſſary, he prevented Supplies from being brought to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and performed his Voyage with great expedition. He was at <hi>Sphagea</hi> a Town in <hi>Laconia</hi> when <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> was ſlain; from thence he went into the Country of <hi>Elis,</hi> and paſſing the Mouth of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> put into Port about a place called <hi>Icthys;</hi> next day he ſailed from thence to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phallenia,</hi> continuing his courſe in that order, ſo as to have all things ready for an Engagement, if occaſion ſerved. For being he had heard nothing about <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> from any that was an Eye Witneſs, he ſuſpected this report might be ſpread pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to catch him, and therefore he was upon his Guard: but afterwards arriving at <hi>Cephallenia,</hi> and being certified of the truth there, he refreſhed his Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I confeſs that Diſcipline and Exerciſe is to be uſed, when there is a proſpect of an Engagement: but this I commend in</hi> Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, <hi>that being to go where he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately expected a Sea Fight, he ſo contrived, that his men ſhould understand what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:58267:196"/>to one, and yet all this Diſcipline did not retard his courſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had taken in the Towns in <hi>Cephallenia,</hi> he went to <hi>Corcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and there having Intelligence of the ten Gallies, which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſent to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> he went himſelf to view in what part of the Country they might be diſcovered when they arrived, and at what place from the Town, they who were to give the ſign of their Arrival might be diſcerned: there he ſet Scouts, and appointed what ſign they ſhould make upon the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and coming into Port. In the mean while, he gave Orders to twenty Captains of Gallies, who were to attend him upon Summons made, and told them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that if they did not, thy muſt thank themſelves for what followed. It was worth while to have ſeen what haſt they made upon the diſcovery of the Enemies Arrival, and the Proclamation made, there being none of them but got aboard with all imaginable diligence. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> went from thence to the place where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Gallies lay, and found that the men were all gone aſhore: Only <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> the <hi>Rhodian</hi> adviſed the reſt not to abide there; and ſhipping his men, departed;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:58267:197"/>and though he met <hi>Iphicrates</hi>'s Fleet, yet he made his eſcape; but the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Ships were taken men and all. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> took off the Jacks of thoſe Ships, and towed them into the Port of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and ſet a certain Ranſom on every man, except <hi>Anippus</hi> the Admiral; whom he kept either to get a good Sum out of, or elſe for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; but he for grief, laid violent hands on himſelf: The reſt <hi>Iphicrates</hi> diſcharged, having taken the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> ſecurity for payment of their Ranſoms. His own Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he maintained, by employing them in Husbandry for the <hi>Corcyreans,</hi> and tranſported the <hi>Targetiers,</hi> and <hi>Heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar'd men</hi> into <hi>Acarnania,</hi> to aſſiſt the Confederate Towns where ever there was occaſion. After that he made War upon the <hi>Thyreans</hi> a valiant People, being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a ſtrong Town: Then he joyned the <hi>Corcyrcan</hi> Fleet, and making ninety Sail, went firſt to <hi>Cephallenia</hi> to raiſe Contribution, which ſome paid freely, and ſome by conſtraint.</p>
               <p>In the next place, he went and rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Country, and took in the Towns in thoſe parts, either by ſurrender, or if they were obſtinate, by force. Of all <hi>Iphicrates</hi>'s Voyages, this in my opinion deſerves not the leaſt praiſe:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58267:197"/>I alſo approve of his taking <hi>Calliſtratus</hi> the Orator along with him, though no very agreeable man for ſuch an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Chabrias</hi> who had the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being a great General. For if he thought them wiſe men, and ſo took them for his Counſellors, this was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently done: Or if he thought them to be Enemies, yet he had ſuch confidence in himſelf, as to be taken doing no ill thing either through cowardize or negligence: This in my opinion was done like a man that was both brave and bold. And theſe were the Exploits of <hi>Iphicrates.</hi>

                  <hi>Not only I</hi> (<hi>my Lords of</hi> Lacedemon) <hi>have been your Publick Host, but my Father and Grandfather have tranſmitted this Hereditary Friendſhip down to their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: I will inform you how the State ſtands affected to our Family; In time of War they chooſe us Generals, and when they deſire Peace, they make us their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. I my ſelf came hither twice before about concluding the War; and in both my Embaſſies I made Peace between the two Nations. Now I come a third time, and hope to obtain an Accommodation upon more
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58267:198"/>reaſonable Terms: For I obſerve we are both of a mind, both having alike reſented the Razing of</hi> Theſpiae <hi>and</hi> Plataeae: <hi>Is it not reaſon then, that thoſe who are of the ſame Interest, ſhould be rather Friends, than Enemies? Certainly no wiſe men will engage in a War upon ſmall Differences: now if we be of the ſame mind, it will be no wonder if a Peace enſue thereupon. In justice we ought not to make War with one another, being</hi> Triptolemus <hi>our Progenitor is reported first to have brought Corn into</hi> Peloponneſus, <hi>and to have initiated</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules <hi>your Founder, together with</hi> Caſtor <hi>and</hi> Pollux <hi>your Country-men, the first of any Strangers, into the ſecret Mysteries of</hi> Ceres <hi>and</hi> Proſerpine: <hi>How then can you in justice come and destroy their Corn, from whom you at firſt received your Seed?

                  <hi>my Lords of</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>what I am going to ſay will not
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58267:199"/>be very grateful to you; yet in my opinion, they that would make a laſting Peace, ſhould firſt declare to each other, the cauſes of the War: You always pretended, that the Cities ſhould enjoy their own Laws, yet you your ſelves are the greateſt Oppoſers of their Liberty. This is the very firſt Article of all your Treaties; That your Confederates ſhould ſerve you in all your Wars: but how is this conſiſtent with their Liberty? being you declare any to be enemies without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it, and then lead your Allies againſt them; ſo that thoſe you are pleaſed to call Free, are neceſſitated to bear Arms againſt the beſt of their Friends: Beſides, you Constitute Governours by Ten men in one place, and by Thirty in another, not regarding whether theſe Magiſtrates Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to Law, ſo they be but able to contain thoſe Cities in Obedience to you by force; whereby you ſeem to be more taken with a tyrannical, than mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Government. When the King propoſed that the Cities ſhould enjoy their own Laws, you pretended that the</hi> Thebans <hi>acted contrary to the Kings Letters, for not permitting each City to be governed by its own Magiſtrates and Laws: but you when you were once poſſeſſed of the Citadel would not ſo much as ſuffer the</hi> Thebans
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58267:199"/>
                  <hi>themſelves to enjoy their own Priviledges. They who would make Peace muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect reaſonable Terms from others, when they ſtick at nothing whereby to aggrandize themſelves.</hi> He put them all to ſilence, and thoſe who had ſuffered by the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> heard him with great ſatisfaction.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I can't deny, my Lords of</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>but that there have been miſcarriages on both ſides, yet my meaning is not, that we must ne're be reconciled to thoſe who have once offended us: I never yet could ſee any man without his failing; Men I find grow wiſer ſometimes by their miſcarriages, eſpecially if they have ſmarted for them, as we both have done. I obſerve that ſome things which were unjuſtly carried on, have thwarted your Deſigns; ſuch was the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal of the Citadel in</hi> Thebes: <hi>For when you made it your whole buſineſs to reſtore the Cities their own Laws, as ſoon as ever the</hi> Thebans <hi>were unjustly treated, all the rest ſided with them: So that I hope you will learn from hence, that Ambition very rarely turns to a good account; and that for the future you will carry it with Moderation in your Alliances to others: They that would oppoſe the Treaty, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly report, as if we were not deſirous
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58267:200"/>of Peace, but afraid leſt</hi> Antalcidas <hi>ſhould return from the King with Money. Conſider with your ſelves how idely theſe men talk; for the King required in his Letters, That all the Cities in</hi> Greece <hi>ſhould be free, and if we both ſay, and do according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them, what need we fear the King? Does any one think that he had rather be at a vaſt Expence to make others great, than to have what he has a mind to done without Expence? But admit it be ſo; why then came we hither? You may eaſily apprehend with a little Conſideration, that Neceſſity brought us not, if you do but call to mind what has been lately done either at Sea or Land: What then can be the reaſon? For certain ſome of the Confederates do that which is neither for our Intereſt nor yours. We have ingeniouſly declared to you our Sentiments, in return for your having been a means of preſerving us. Now if I must ſpeak of the Advantage to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a War, ſome Cities will ſide with ours, and ſome with yours; and in every one, ſome there will be who will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the</hi> Athenians, <hi>and others that will take part with the</hi> Lacedemonians: <hi>If therefore both Nations were at Amity, whom could we have any apprehenſions of? If ye are our Friends, who can incommode
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58267:200"/>us by Land? and if we ſtand by you, who can moleſt you by Sea? We all know, that Wars often break out, and are again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: and though we don't now, yet in time we may long for Peace. Why then don't we come to an Accommodation as ſoon as we can, but ſtill delay the time, till we be overcome by the multitude of our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſome incurable Evil does ariſe? I do not approve of thoſe who having often bore away the Prize, and gain'd Reputation thereby, grow ſo in love with Combating, as not to forbear till they are beaten, and then give over exerciſing. Nor do I like your Dice-players, who if they win one Game, will double the Stake; for I ſee many of them quite broke, whom we ought ſo far to take example from, leſt we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch a Game, ſo as either to win or loſe all. Let us therefore be Friends one with another, whilſt we are in a good and proſperous condition: ſo we by our mutual aſſiſtance ſhall become more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in</hi> Greece, <hi>than we have been any ages heretofore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All of them were thought to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt very well, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> decreed that a Peace ſhould be accepted on theſe Terms: That they the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> ſhould recal all their Governours
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58267:201"/>out of the Cities, and disband their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both at Sea and Land; that the Cities ſhould enjoy their own Laws; and if any ſhould act contrary hereto, that whoſoever would might aſſiſt the injured Cities, but if any would not, they ſhould not be obliged thereto by Oath. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſwore to theſe Articles for themſelves and their Allies; as did the <hi>Athenians</hi> and their Confederates, in the name of their reſpective Cities. Amongſt the reſt that ſwore to the Articles, the <hi>Thebans</hi> entred their Names, and the day following when their Ambaſſadors came to deſire that it might be inſerted; <hi>The</hi> Boeotians <hi>had ratiſied the Peace inſtead of the</hi> Thebans. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> made anſwer, He would not alter any thing of what they had Sworn and Recorded at firſt; and that if they would not ſtand to the Treaty, they ſhould be blotted out if they pleaſed. So the reſt having made Peace, the Controverſie remained only about the <hi>Thebans;</hi> and it was the opinion of the <hi>Athenians</hi> themſelves, that 'twas to be feared the <hi>Thebans</hi> would, as it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſcourſt, be<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>After this, the <hi>Athenians</hi> drew their
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:58267:201"/>Gariſons out of all the Cities, and called home <hi>Iphicrates</hi> with the Fleet, obliging him to reſtore all he had taken ſince the concluſion of the Peace at <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> In like manner,<note place="margin">Phraſicli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon.</note> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did the ſame to the Cities they were poſſeſt of. When <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> who commanded the Army in <hi>Phocis,</hi> conſulted the Magiſtrates at home, how he ſhould govern himſelf; <hi>Prothous</hi> ſaid, That in his opinion the Army ought to be Disbanded purſuant to the Treaty, and notice to be given to the Cities for every one to contribute what they thought fit to the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and if any oppoſed their Liberty, then to exhort ſuch of the Confederates as would defend the common Intereſt, to declare War againſt them; adding, he thought the Gods in this caſe would be very favourable to their Cauſe, and the Cities ſuccour the Injured. The Council hearing him ſay ſo, thought he talkt idlely; for in all probability they were poſſeſt, and ſent Orders to <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> not to Disband his Army, but to march directly againſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> unleſs they would let the Cities enjoy their own Laws: For <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> hearing that Peace was made, ſent to the <hi>Ephori</hi> for Orders, and they gave him theſe Inſtructions.</p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:58267:202"/>
               <p>Therefore when he underſtood that they were ſo far from reſtoring the Cities their Laws, and Disbanding their Forces, that they took the Field againſt him; he marched with his Army into <hi>Baeotia,</hi> yet did not enter from out of <hi>Phocis</hi> at a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Paſs which was guarded by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> where they expected he would, but paſſed over the Mountains unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly by the way of <hi>Thisbe,</hi> and arriving at <hi>Creuſis,</hi> took twelve <hi>Theban</hi> Gallies together with the Town.</p>
               <p>When he had performed this Exploit, he marched up from the Sea-coaſt, and Encamped at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> which is in the Territory of <hi>Thespiae.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi> had their Camp over againſt them at a ſmall diſtance on a Hill, having joyned none of the Allies except the <hi>Baeotians.</hi> There <hi>Cleombrotus</hi>'s Friends came to him, &amp; ſaid, <hi>Cleombrotus!</hi> If you ſuffer the <hi>Thebans</hi> to go off without fighting, you'l go nigh to loſe your Head; for it will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, how you did not burn the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>'s Country when you were at <hi>Cynoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phale,</hi> and that in another Campagn you were repulſed from the Paſs over the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theron,</hi> which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> always gained. Therefore, if either you regard your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or care for living in your own
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58267:202"/>Country, you muſt engage them. This was his Friends Advice. But his Enemies cried, Now he will diſcover whether he, as 'tis reported, has any real reſpect for the <hi>Thebans</hi> or no. When <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> heard this, he was egg'd on to fight. On the other hand, the <hi>Theban</hi> Captains conſidered, that if they gave him not Battel, the adjacent Towns would revolt, that they ſhould be beſieged; and that if the people of <hi>Thebes</hi> wanted Proviſions, the City would go near to riſe up againſt them.

               <p>When he arrived in <hi>Baeotia,</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> ſignified to him, that they had then an opportunity of falling upon the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> and that whilſt he attacked them with his <hi>Mercenaries</hi> from an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, they would ſet upon them in the Front. But he diverted them from this their Deſign, adviſing them not to aim ſtill at greater things, ſince they had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo brave an Exploit already, leſt they ſhould be deprived of the advantage of the Victory they had lately obtain'd. <hi>Don't you know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that when you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremities, you then became vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, and therefore you ſhould conſider, that if the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>be once made weary of their lives, they too will grow deſperate, and fight it out to the laſt man.

This he ſpoke, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rather with intention to divide them, that ſo both might ſtand in need of his aſſiſtance. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hearing him ſay ſo, deſired him to negotiate a Truce; and when News came that it was concluded, the Generals commanded all to prepare themſelves, and after they had ſupped, to decamp in the Night, that by break of Day, they might be march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But they marcht on very heavily (for being it was Night, they departed in fear, and the way was bad) and came to <hi>Aegosthena</hi> in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Megara.</hi> There they met <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamus</hi>'s Army, who ſtayed till all the Confederates were come up, and then marched with his Forces as far as <hi>Corinth;</hi> where he diſmiſt the Auxiliaries, and marcht with the <hi>Spartans</hi> home.</p>

When he came to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea,</hi> he took the Town, not that he feared any would fall into his Countrey, though that Paſs were open; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered rather, if any ſhould poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> which ſtood in a ſtrait place, they might keep him out, if he ſhould entertain a Deſign of invading <hi>Greece.</hi> After he returned back into <hi>Theſſaly</hi> be became a very great man, both becauſe he was made General by a

               <p>When the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games drew near he gave out an Order amongſt the Cities to feed Oxen, Sheep, Goats, and Hogs, and to provide them for the Sacrifice. 'Tis ſaid that he taxed every City, tho' mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, no leſs than one thouſand Oxen, &amp; ten thouſand other Cattle, proclaiming a Crown of Gold for a Prize to that City, which fed the fatteſt Ox for the Sacrifice of <hi>Apollo;</hi> and ſent Orders to the <hi>Theſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to prepare themſelves for the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn, againſt the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games; having thoughts, as the report went, to be Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent himſelf of the Solemnity and Prizes. But what he thought to do with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Money is not yet known; for it being reported that when the <hi>Delphians</hi> conſulted what they ſhould do, if <hi>Jaſon</hi> offered to ſeize it; the God anſwered, that he could take care of that himſelf.

               <p>After his Death <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron</hi> Brothers, were made <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi>'s; but in their Journey to <hi>Lariſſa, Polydorus</hi> whilſt he was ſleeping in the Night, was killed by his Brother <hi>Polyphron,</hi> as 'tis thought; for his Death was ſuddain and without any apparent Cauſes. <hi>Polyphron</hi> governed one Year, converting his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralſhip into a Tyranny; putting <hi>Polyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and eight more of the Principal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to death at <hi>Pharſalus,</hi> and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

This <hi>Alexander</hi> taking upon him the Adminiſtration of Government became troubleſome both to the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> and <hi>Thebans;</hi> an Enemy to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> a Rogue at Land, and a Pirate at Sea. He having plaid ſuch pranks was murdered by the inſtigation of his Wife, and aſſiſtance of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſhe having told them that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had a Deſign againſt them, and hid them in her Houſe a whole Day. At Night having laid him to ſleep drunk, ſhe light a Candle, and brought out his Sword; but finding that her Brothers delayed to make their attempt upon him, ſhe told them if they would not do the Work ſhe would awake him. When they entered ſhe pulled to the door, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it till her Husband was diſpatched. Some ſay this hatred againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was, becauſe when he had impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Page a beautiful Youth, and ſhe interceeded for his releaſe, he brought him out, and cut his Throat; others, for that having no Children by her, he had ſent to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and engaged himſelf to <hi>Jaſon</hi>'s Wife. Theſe are the reports
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:58267:208"/>that go about concerning his Wife's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. <hi>Tiſiphonus</hi> the eldeſt Brother held the Government from the time of the Conſpiracy till the writing of this Book.

               <p>Afterwards <hi>Archidamus</hi> who was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Recruits to <hi>Leuctra,</hi> returned home with the Army. The <hi>Athenians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> thought they were ſtil obliged to ſerve the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> in the Wars, and that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> were now in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they had formerly reduced the <hi>Athenians</hi> to; ſent about to all the Cities that would come into the League propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the King.

If any one ſhall make War againſt any of theſe Cities that have ſworn to this Peace, I will oppoſe them with my utmoſt Power.</hi> All the reſt were very well ſatisfied with the Oath; only the <hi>Eleans</hi> objected, that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58267:209"/>the Cities of the <hi>Marganeans, Scylluntians,</hi> and <hi>Triphylians</hi> might not be free; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe were their Towns.

And all took the Oath except the <hi>Eleans.</hi> Then the <hi>Mantineans</hi> as being abſolutely free, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, decreed to make <hi>Mantinea</hi> one Town, and to wall it; but the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> thinking it an hard caſe that this ſhould be done without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſent <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> thither, who was ſaid to have a kind of Fatherly care over them. When he arrived the Chiefmen told him they would not aſſemble the People for him: but bid him tell them his Buſineſs. He promiſed them if they would forbear fortifying at preſent, he would procure that the Wall ſhould be built with little charge, and with the approbation of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> But being told they could not poſſibly deſiſt becauſe it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the Community, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> went way in an heat, though he thought a War would not be declared againſt them, by reaſon the Peace was made for Liberty.

In this Skirmiſh <hi>Polytropus</hi> was ſlain, and many more had been killed in the flight, if the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Horſe had not wheeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſtopt their further purſuit by attacking the <hi>Mantineans</hi> Rear.</p>
               <p>After this Exploit the <hi>Mantineans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> hearing of it, and concluding that the <hi>Orchomenian</hi> Mercenaries would not joyn them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in this manner; The firſt day he ſupped in the Territory (of <hi>Tegea</hi>) and the day after paſſing into that of <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> he encamped under the Hills that are to the Weſtward of the City. There he burnt the Countrey, and deſtroyed the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58267:211"/>Fields. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> that were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Aſea,</hi> got into <hi>Tegea</hi> by Night; and next Day <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> encamped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty Furlongs of <hi>Mantinea.</hi> The <hi>Arcadians</hi> coming with a ſtrong Body of Heavy-armed men from <hi>Tegea,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reached the Hills betwixt <hi>Mantinea</hi> and that Place, they were very earneſt to joyn the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Argives</hi> had not ſent all their Forces thither. Some there were who perſwaded <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> to fall upon them ſeparately; but he fearing that whilſt he attacked them, the <hi>Mantineans</hi> out of the Town would fall upon his Flank and Rear, concluded it would be beſt to let them joyn, and then if they would fight, they ſhould have a fair and open Field.</p>
               <p>By this time the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> as he was ſacrificing before the Camp by day-break, diſcovered the Targetiers from <hi>Orchomenus,</hi> together with the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Horſe, who marched in the Night by <hi>Mantinea:</hi> whereupon <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was obliged to return to his Arms, and the reſt to run to their Ranks. In the Evening he encamped undiſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Vally ſurrounded by the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the back of the <hi>Mantinean</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. Next day as he was ſacrificing at
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58267:212"/>the Head of the Army, he diſcovered the <hi>Mantineans</hi> aſſembled on the top of thoſe Hills that overlookt his Rear, upon which he reſolved to draw his men out of the Valley, but fearing if he marcht from thence, that the Enemy would fall upon his Rear, he lay ſtill, and commanded thoſe in the Rear to face about, to direct their Arms towards the Enemy, and to move to the right towards their Leader. By this means he both drew his Troops out of the ſtrait Paſs, and re-inforc'd his Battalion, which when he had doubled, he marcht into the Plain in that Order and there extended it nine or ten deep.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mantineans</hi> came out no more, becauſe the <hi>Eleans</hi> their Confederates had perſwaded them not to fight till the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> had joyned them,<note place="margin">187. <abbr>

                  </note> being aſſured of their coming, for that they had borrowed ten Talents of them for this expedition. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> when they heard this kept themſelves within the Walls of <hi>Mantinea. Ageſilaus</hi> though he had a great deſire to march away with the Army, it being in the midſt of Winter, yet he ſtay'd three days in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> that he might not be thought to haſten his departure for fear of the Enemy. On the fourth day he refreſhed his Army
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:58267:212"/>early, and began his march, making ſhew as if he would encamp in the Place where he did when he firſt ſet out from <hi>Eutaea.</hi> But when none of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he, though very much belated, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diligence to <hi>Eutaea,</hi> intending to depart with the Heavy-armed men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enemies fires were diſcovered, that none might ſay he fled, whereby he ſeemed to have allayed the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Countreymen were in before, becauſe though he had entered <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and burned it, yet none would undertake to fight him. As ſoon as he arrived in <hi>Laconia</hi> he ſent home his <hi>Spartans,</hi> and diſmiſſed the Neighbouring Troops to go to their reſpective Cities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arcadians</hi> receiving Intelligence, that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was marcht out of their Countrey, and had disbanded his Army, got together in a ſtrong Body, &amp; fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Heraeans,</hi> for refuſing to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with them, for invading <hi>Arcadia</hi> with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> for firing their Houſes, and cutting down the Trees in their Incurſions. But when there came News that the <hi>Thebans</hi> were coming to relieve <hi>Mantinea,</hi> they left <hi>Heraea</hi> and joyned them: after the Armies were united, the <hi>Thebans</hi> thinking all was well,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58267:213"/>becauſe they had ſuccoured their Allies, and no Enemy appeared in the Countrey, prepared for their departure. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians, Argives,</hi> and <hi>Eleans</hi> perſuaded the <hi>Thebans</hi> to march directly into <hi>Laconia,</hi> making oſtentation of their Numbers, and magnifying their Army, for all the <hi>Boeotians</hi> were very well diſciplined, and elated with their Victory at <hi>Leuctra.</hi> There followed them in this Expedition their Subjects the <hi>Phoceans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acarnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleans, <hi>and</hi> Melieans.</note> and Forces out of all the Cities of <hi>Euboea,</hi> both the <hi>Locri,</hi> and Horſe, and Targetiers out of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They therefore well informing the <hi>Thebans</hi> of the Deſolation which was in <hi>Laconia,</hi> entreated them, that they would not by any means march away before they had made an Incurſion into that Countrey. The <hi>Thebans</hi> indeed gave them the hearing, but conſidered on the other hand, that <hi>Laconia</hi> was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be invaded, thinking there might be Guards ſet to defend thoſe Places which were moſt eaſie to be paſſed. For <hi>Iſcholaus</hi> was at <hi>Ius</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Sciris</hi> with a Garriſon of four hundred ſtout men, conſiſting partly of half Slaves, and partly of the Exiles of <hi>Tegea.</hi> There was another Garriſon too near <hi>Leuctra</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Maleatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:58267:213"/>
               <p>Moreover the <hi>Thebans</hi> conſidered that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would ſoon unite, and that they would fight no where better than upon their own Ground. Upon all theſe Confiderations they were not very forward to march to <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> but afterwards when ſome came from <hi>Caryae,</hi> and reported the Countrey was in no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Defence, proffering to guide the Army, and offering themſelves to be cut in pieces if they impoſed upon them; There came alſo ſeveral of the Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood to invite and to inform them, that if they did but appear in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they would revolt, and added, that the Neighbours were lately ſummoned by the <hi>Spartans,</hi> but would not aſſiſt them. The <hi>Thebans</hi> hearing all theſe Reports, and from ſeveral hands, were over-perſwaded, and fell into <hi>Laconia</hi> about <hi>Caryae,</hi> as did the <hi>Arcadians</hi> near <hi>Ius</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Sciris.</hi> Though if <hi>Iſcholaus</hi> had but gone before, and ſecured the difficult Paſſes, 'twas ſaid, none could have entered on that ſide; but he deſigning to joyn thoſe of <hi>Ius,</hi> tarried for them at that Village, where the <hi>Arcadians</hi> came upon them in great Numbers; and here <hi>Iſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>'s men facing about, and charging the Enemy, got the better. But at laſt
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58267:214"/>when thoſe on the Houſes threw their Lances, and darted their Javelins both at the Rear and Flank, <hi>Iſcholaus</hi> and all the reſt fell, except any might eſcape undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arcadians</hi> having performed this Exploit, marcht towards <hi>Caryoe</hi> to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who having heard of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, came down into the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey the more boldly, and immediately deſtroyed and burnt <hi>Sellaſia.</hi> When they came into the Champion Countrey they encamped in a Grove of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s, but made no attempt the day following to paſs over the Bridge into the City, becauſe they found that the Enemies heavy-arm'd men were in the Temple of <hi>Minerva Alea,</hi> but left the <hi>Eurotas</hi> on the right, and marcht on plundering, deſtroying and burning the Houſes which were rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſht. The Women in the City, having never ſeen the face of an Enemy before could not endure ſo much as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſmoke. The men though their fewneſs appeared, being poſted in ſeveral Places, nevertheleſs defended the City though it had no Walls. The Magiſtrates thought it convenient to proclaim to the Slaves, that if they would form themſelves into Companies, and come into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58267:214"/>as many as did ſhould have Security to be free. 'Tis ſaid, there were above ſix thouſand liſted in an inſtant, ſo that when they were armed, and made ſo great and appearance they ſtruck a terrour into the <hi>Spartans</hi> themſelves. But when the Mercenaries from <hi>Orchomenus</hi> ſtaid there, and the <hi>Phliaſians, Corinthians, Epidaurians,</hi> and <hi>Pellenians,</hi> with ſome Forces from othe Cities came to their aſſiſtance, they then leſs dreaded thoſe new raiſed men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Theban</hi> Army advancing towards <hi>Amyclae,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Eurotas</hi> there, and forthwith they cut down as many Trees as they could where they encamped, and placing them before their Camp guarded it therewith. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> took diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent meaſures, for they left their Arms, and went to plundering. Three or four days after, all the <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Elean</hi> Horſe, together with the <hi>Phoceans, Theſſalians,</hi> and <hi>Locrians</hi> came to the<note n="*" place="margin">

The Enemy
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58267:215"/>never ſtood them, but gave Ground which ſeveral of the Foot ſeeing gave ground too. After the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had given over the purſuit, the <hi>Thebans</hi> halted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped again; but it being thought ſomewhat too dangerous an Adventure to attempt the City a ſecond time, the Army decamped, and marched towards <hi>Helos,</hi> and <hi>Gytheum.</hi> The Cities which had no Walls they burnt, and attacked <hi>Gythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> where the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had a Yard for building of Ships, three days together.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> hearing of theſe Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and being very ſollicitous what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to take concerning the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Affairs, called an Aſſembly by order of the Senate, at which the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the reſt of their remaining Friends were preſent.<note place="margin">Aratus, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyllus, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Olon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</note> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſpoke all of them much to the ſame purpoſe, putting the <hi>Athenians</hi> in mind, that both States had aſſiſted each other in the moſt Critical times with happy Succeſs, and ſhew how they drave the XXX Tyrants out of <hi>Athens,</hi> and that on the contrary the <hi>Athenians</hi> had readily aſſiſted them, when the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> beſieged them; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the good Succeſs when both acted
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58267:215"/>joyntly, and commemorating how they with their united Forces had driven the <hi>Barbarian</hi> out of <hi>Greece,</hi> reminding them alſo that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals at ſea,<note place="margin">The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were entruſted with a Fond of Money raiſed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to carry on a War againſt the <hi>Perſian.

               <p>One of the Ambaſſadors made a Speech to this purpoſe. <hi>If both the States, My Lords of</hi> Athens, <hi>joyn together, there is hopes that the</hi> Thebans, <hi>as was formerly diſcourſed, may be totally ruined.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> gave not much heed to what he ſaid, but ſuch a kind of muttering as this ran through the Aſſembly, how that they ſaid ſo now, though when they were in proſperity, they were our bitter Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Yet the moſt material Argument the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were thought to urge, was, That when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had ſubdued the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the <hi>Thebans</hi> would have razed the City, the former hindred them from putting their Deſign in Execution. So the general Diſcourſe was, that they ſhould have Succors purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Treaty. For the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and their Confederates did not make War
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:58267:216"/>upon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for any Injury they had done, but becauſe they aſſiſted the <hi>Tegeans</hi> againſt whom the <hi>Mantine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had employed their Arms contrary to the Treaty. Upon theſe Debates a Clamour ran through the Aſſembly, ſome ſaying that the <hi>Mantineans</hi> did well in aſſiſting <hi>Proxenus</hi>'s Party who were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by <hi>Staſippus</hi>'s Faction, and others that they had broke the Treaty by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of War againſt the <hi>Tegeans.</hi> Whiles the Aſſembly were debating the Matter, <hi>Cliteles</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> roſe up and ſpoke.</p>
               <p>Perhaps,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cliteles</hi>'s Speech.</note> 
                  <hi>My Lords of</hi> Athens, it may be a Question who were the Aggreſſors: Yet can any one lay to our charge, that we ſince the Concluſion of the Peace, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any Place, made any Depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ravaged any Countrey? Though the <hi>Thebans</hi> have invaded ours, and cut down the Trees, fired our Houſes, plundered our Goods, and drave away our Cattle. How then can you ſatisfie your Oath, if you do not ſuccour us, being we are ſo manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injured, and the Ratification of the Treaty was by your procurement. <hi>The</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians <hi>heard him with Applauſe, he having offered what was equitable and juſt. After him</hi> Patrocles <hi>the</hi> Phliaſian <hi>roſe up and ſpake.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:58267:216"/>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, <hi>My Lords of</hi> Athens,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Patrocles</hi>'s Speech.</note> 'tis manifest to all, that when the <hi>Thebans</hi> have ruined the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> in the next place they will attack you; for they are ſenſible that you are the only obstacle, which hinder them from becoming Lords of all <hi>Greece.</hi> Seeing therefore Affairs ſtand thus, you will in my opinion do your ſelves as much Service as the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> by making War upon them. For I imagine it will be much more troubleſome to have the <hi>Thebans</hi> who border upon you, and are ill affected, to be Lords of <hi>Greece,</hi> than to have your Enemies at a farther diſtance. And you will defend your ſelves with more advantage, now whilst there remain ſome Allies, than if they be ruined, and you alone be forced to fight it out with the <hi>Thebans.</hi> If any fear that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi> if they eſcape this time will create you trouble hereafter, conſider that we need not apprehend the growth of thoſe we have deſerved well of, but thoſe we have injured. Moreover you ſhould take this into conſideration, that States as well as private Perſons ought to make Friends, when in a flouriſhing condition, that if they be reduced to a ſtrait, they may expect aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from thoſe they have obliged. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has at this time put a ſignal oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:58267:217"/>into your hands, and if you will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in this their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, you will for ever make them your most faithful Friends. Nor will you have a few witneſſes of your Benefaction, the Confederates and Enemies, nay the whole World ſhall be eye-witneſſes hereof, the Gods themſelves who have in proſpect all things past, preſent and to come, ſhall be Spectators of it from Heaven. Nothing of this ſhall be forgotten, for if the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> prove ungrateful to you, who will aſſist them at any time hereafter? though in Charity we ought to hope the best of them, and that they won't be diſingenuous. For there is no People have had greater Principles of Honour than they, nor more carefully ſhun'd the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of baſeneſs. Beſides, conſider if ever any danger from the <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſhall threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our Countrey, whom can you confide in more, or would rather chuſe for your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, than thoſe who being posted at the <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> choſe rather to die upon the Spot than live, and let the <hi>Barbarian</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Greece?</hi> Ought not we therefore in Justice to do them all the good Offices we can, who have acquitted themſelves with us with ſo much bravery, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility will do the like for the future? Nor
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:58267:217"/>would you looſe your labour in ſhewing them reſpect upon the Allies account, for aſſure your ſelves, that theſe who continue their faithful Friends in distreſs, will in honour render you the like piece of Service in their Name. If theſe States of ours that would engage in this danger, ſeem inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, yet by the conjunction of yours, they will make up a Formidable Power. Heretofore, <hi>My Lords of</hi> Athens, I had your City in admiration, when I heard all who were either injured or had any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of their Enemies fled hither for refuge, and obtained the relief they ſought. Now I hear no longer, but am preſent and ſee, that the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Nation in the World, and their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Allies are come hither to implore your Aſſiſtance. I my ſelf ſee the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> who formerly could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by the <hi>Thebans</hi> utterly to deſtroy you, now begging of you not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to be deſtroyed, who preſerved you. 'Tis to the Honour of your Anceſtors, that they would not permit thoſe <hi>Argives</hi> to lie unburied, who periſhed at the Citadel of <hi>Thebes,</hi> it will be much more to your Fame, not to let the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> yet living either to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or deſtroyed. This was honourably
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:58267:218"/>done by you, when you curbed the Inſolence of <hi>Euriſtheus</hi> to preſerve <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; but is it not more honourable to ſave not only the Princes, but the whole Republick? and this moſt honourable of all, if when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> preſerved you by a word of their mouth, for you in return to expoſe your Lives in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? If it be matter of ſo great joy for us only to ſpeak in the behalf of ſuch Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men, it will be thought a generous part in you, to aſſist them with your Arms, and ſince you have been ſeveral times Allies and Enemies, to remember rather the good Offices than the Injuries received from them; whereby you will make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, not only in their Name, but in the Name of all <hi>Greece,</hi> to thoſe who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves with ſo much Gallantry in it's Defence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> deliberating upon the Matter, would not endure to hear the oppoſite Party, but reſolved that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> ſhould be aſſiſted with their whole Force, and choſe <hi>Iphicrates</hi> their General, who having a lucky Sacrifice, commanded his men to ſup in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, whither ſeveral arrived before him. Soon after he began his March, and the whole Army followed as going
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:58267:218"/>upon ſome glorious Expedition. But when he came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there ſome Days; for which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the Army blamed him, yet when he began to march again, the Army followed him with that alacrity, that they would readily have attacked <hi>Argos</hi> it ſelf, if he had led them againſt it: In the mean while the <hi>Arcadians, Argives, Eleans,</hi> and ſeveral of the Enemies, who were Borderers left the Service, going about ravaging and ſpoyling what ever they could light on. The <hi>Thebans,</hi> and the reſt were for returning home, becauſe they ſaw their Army waſted, and their Proviſions grow daily ſcarcer, ſome being ſpent, others taken from them, ſome ſquandred away, and others burnt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it was Winter, and all deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to their own Countrey. So <hi>Iphicrates</hi> marcht with the <hi>Athenians</hi> out of <hi>Corinth</hi> at the ſame time they left <hi>Laconia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find no fault with his Conduct in other Expeditions; but I obſerve all he did in this, was either done to no purpoſe, or with no advantage. For when he undertook to defend <hi>Oneum,</hi> and cut off the Retreat of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> he left the moſt important Paſs at <hi>Cenchreae</hi> unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58267:219"/>and ſent all the <hi>Athenian</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Horſe upon the Scout to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whether the <hi>Thebans</hi> had paſſed the <hi>Oneum,</hi> though a great many could ſee no more than a few, and a ſmall Party if they were obliged to retreat, could retire with more ſecurity than a great Body. Is it not therefore a great piece of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence to ſend out a Party, which is weaker than the Forces of the Enemy? For being the Horſe were many, they covered a great deal of Ground; and when they were obliged to retire, they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral rough Places, ſo that no leſs than twenty of them periſht, and the <hi>Thebans</hi> marched away at their Liberty.</p>

               <p>THe Year following,<note place="margin">Olymp. <hi>103.</hi> Niuſigenes Archon.</note> the Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and Confederates came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> to treat of an Alliance between the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and the <hi>Athenians.</hi> And ſeveral as well of the Allies, as <hi>Athenians,</hi> declaring it ought to be made upon equal and like Terms, <hi>Procles</hi> the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> made this Speech:
<q>
                     <p>My Lords of <hi>Athens;</hi> ſince you have thought fit to make the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> your Friends, you ought, in my opinion, to conſider how this Alliance may be made laſting. If therefore we make a League that may be advantageous to both ſides, ſuch an one, in all probability will be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kept. There only remains the point about the Command in Chief to be ſettled; in other matters we are almost agreed. The States have already reſolved, that you ſhould command by Sea, and the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> by Land. Which <hi>Partition</hi> ſeems to me, not to have been the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of human wit, but the Reſult of the Divine Wiſdom, and the diſpoſition of Providence. For first of all ye have a place exceedingly well contriv'd by nature for it, and many Towns lie near your City that depend upon the Commerce at Sea, all
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58267:220"/>which are of leſs power than yours. You have Ports too, without which your Naval Forces would be of no uſe, and many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: 'Tis a Maxim alſo of your State to maintain a powerful Fleet. Moreover, the Trades which belong to <hi>Shipping</hi> are all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to you, who far excel other Nations in the Art of Navigation. Moſt of you ſubſiſt by the Sea; ſo that at the ſame time you follow your own private occaſions, and gain experience in the Maritine Diſcipline. Nor can any ſet out ſo numerous a Fleet of Gallies as you, which is of no ſmall moment towards the obtaining the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Chief. For all deſire to join with them that are moſt powerful, and Heaven has conferr'd that Happineſs on you: for tho you have had ſo many, and ſo great Engagements at Sea, yet you have ſeldom miſcarried, but commonly been victorious; ſo that there can hardly be any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe in which the Allies will refuſe to engage with you. Conſider then that this is a matter of the greateſt moment and conſequence to you; for tho the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> have made war upon you ſo many years, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of your Country, yet they never endanger'd your Ruine, till Heaven gave them the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Sea; and then they ſoon
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58267:221"/>brought you under ſubjection. 'Tis plain therefore your preſervation depends wholly on the Sea; and ſince you are ſo fitted for it by nature, how can you in honor ſuffer the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to command there? For firſt they acknowledge themſelves leſs experienced in Naval Affairs than you are; and beſides, the dangers that they run in Sea-fights are not equal to yours; for they adventure only the loſs of their Men on board their Gallies; but you fight for your Wives, your Children, and your whole Country. This is the ſtate of your Affairs; and that of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> is as follows.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they inhabit an in-land Country; and therefore, tho they be ſhut out from Sea, they can ſubſist well enough on the Land. For this reaſon they are trained up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from their Child-hood in the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice; and by their exact Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which is very material, become as powerful at Land as you at Sea. Moreover, they they can as ſoon draw out a potent Army, as you can equip a Fleet; which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability will be a ſtrong inducement to the Confederates to join with them. Again, as Heaven has given them ſucceſs by Land, ſo it has to you at Sea; for of the many Battels they have fought, they have been
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58267:221"/>victorious in moſt, and miſcarried but in few. You may underſtand then by their Atchievments, that the care of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice is no leſs neceſſary for them, than that of Sea for you. For tho you have made war with them at Sea theſe ſeveral years, and beat them ſeveral times, yet you did nothing conſiderable towards the ſubduing them, till once they were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by Land, and then their Wives, their Children, and all their Country were in danger. Would it not then be an hard caſe for them to reſign up their command at Land to others, who are capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it ſo well themſelves? I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have declared my ſelf to be of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Senate, as judging it most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for both ſides; and may all your Counſels be crowned with ſucceſs, whileſt you conſult the common intereſt of us all.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he. His Oration was highly commended both by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and all the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> there preſent. Then <hi>Cephiſodotus</hi> riſing up, came forth into the midſt of the Aſſembly, and ſpoke,
<q>My Lords of <hi>Athens,</hi> Don't you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelves to be impoſed upon? and if you will pleaſe to hear me, I'll ſoon
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58267:222"/>make it appear in what manner. You for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footh ſhall command at Sea, and the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> your Confederates will perhaps find Captains of Gallies, and Soldiers that are <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> but the Seamen ſhall be either Slaves or Hirelings; and theſe are the men that you muſt command. But when they ſhall ſummon you to joyn with them in any Expedition by Land, you muſt ſend them Horſe and heavy-arm'd men: ſo that they ſhall command you your ſelves; but you only their Slaves, and ſuch kind of pitiful Fellows. Anſwer me then, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you <hi>Timocrates</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> did you not affirm but juſt now, that you came to treat with us upon equal terms? I did ſo, <hi>ſaid</hi> Timocrates. Is there any thing then, <hi>ſaid</hi> Cephiſodotus, more equal than that we ſhould command in our turns both at Sea and Land: and if there be any advantage in the command at Sea, that ye ſhould participate of it, as well as we of that at Land?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> hearing this, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to alter their opinion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that each ſide ſhould command five days alternately. Afterwards when they and their Confederates made War againſt <hi>Corinth,</hi> 'twas thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to guard the Mount <hi>Oneum</hi> with their
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58267:222"/>joint Forces; ſo that when the <hi>Thebans</hi> and their Allies march'd thither, they poſted themſelves in ſeveral parts of the Mount, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> with the <hi>Pellenians,</hi> in thoſe places which were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt to be aſſaulted. When the <hi>Thebans</hi> came within thirty Furlongs of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they encamped on the Plain, and computing what time they ſhould ſpend in their March from their firſt ſetting out, they advanced towards the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by twilight. Nor were they miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their time; for they fell upon them and the <hi>Pellenians</hi> juſt as the Night-Watch ended, and every one was raiſing himſelf out of his Bed. There the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> being provided, fell upon thoſe that were not; thoſe in order, upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered. As ſoon as thoſe that eſcaped the Action retired to the adjacent Hill, the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Collonel might have taken what heavy-arm'd Men, and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getiers of the Confederates he would, and by their aſſiſtance have poſſeſs'd himſelf of the place; for Proviſions might eaſily have been conveyed from <hi>Cenchreoe</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but he neglected this opprtunity. For whilſt the <hi>Thebans</hi> were in ſuſpence whether they ſhould march down the way to <hi>Sicyon,</hi> or retreat back again,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58267:223"/>the Colonel made Truce, though moſt people thought 'twas more for the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban's</hi> advantage than his own: after this he marched off with his Army.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> march'd ſeverally down the Hill, and having joyned their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, immediately attacked <hi>Sicycon</hi> and <hi>Pellene:</hi> Afterwards they entred <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidaurus,</hi> burnt all the Country, and marched back greatly ſcorning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning their Enemy; and when they approach'd near <hi>Corinth,</hi> they run full ſpeed up to the Gates that look towards <hi>Phlius,</hi> with an intention to break in, if they found them open; but ſome of the Light-arm'd men ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Town, met their Body not above four hundred foot from the Walls, and mounting upon the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Eminent Places, killed a great many of the foremoſt of them with their Spears and Lances, routing and purſuing them about three or four Furlongs. After the Action, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> dragging the dead bodies nearer the Walls, reſtored them upon Truce, and erected a Trophy: Upon this the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Allies took heart again.</p>
               <p>About this time there arrived Auxiliaries from <hi>Dionyſius</hi> to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> with
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:58267:223"/>above twenty Gallies that brought on board about fifty <hi>Celtic</hi> and <hi>Iberian</hi> horſe. Next day the <hi>Thebans</hi> and their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates entred the Country in an Hoſtile manner, covering the Plain as far as the Sea and the Hills near the City, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all before them. The <hi>Athenian</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Cavalry, when they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſtrength, and numbers of the Enemy, did not come very near them: Yet <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Horſe though a few in number advanced in ſmall Parties, and threw their Lances, but the Enemy falling upon them, they retreated, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing again, darted their Lances as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But when any Charged them as they were lighting off their Horſes, and reſted themſelves, they nimbly mounted again and retreated: And when they were purſued any diſtance from the main Body, they attacked their Purſuers, and did great execution upon them with their Lances, compelling the whole Army both to Advance and Retreat, according to their Motions. The <hi>Thebans</hi> returned home not many days after, and ſo did the whole Army. <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Troops made an attempt upon <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and beat the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> in a fair Field, killing about ſeventy, and took the Fort <hi>Deras</hi> by
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:58267:224"/>Storm. Theſe were the firſt Auxiliaries ſent by <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> who after they had performed theſe Exploits, ſailed home to <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> and thoſe that had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> did every thing till this time by general conſent, and the <hi>Thebans</hi> wholly managed the War: But there aroſe one <hi>Lycomedes</hi> a <hi>Mantinean,</hi> in Birth inferiour to none, Wealthy and Ambitious; who puff'd up the <hi>Arcadians</hi> with high Conceits, telling them, <hi>That</hi> Peloponneſus <hi>was only their Country, and they its firſt Inhabitants: That they were the moſt numerous Nation of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and men of very able bodies; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this as a Proof of their Proweſs, that when there was occaſion for Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, none were preferred before them. Moreover that the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>never attacked</hi> Athens <hi>without the</hi> Arcadians; <hi>nor had the</hi> Thebans <hi>come now againſt</hi> Lacedemon, <hi>had they not been ſupported by them. Wherefore if you are wiſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>no longer follow others Command, for before when you ſerved the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>you advanced them, and if you ſtill incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately engage with the</hi> Thebans, <hi>and don't ſeek to command in your turns, you will perhaps find them</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>too.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:58267:224"/>
               <p>The <hi>Arcadians</hi> hearing this, became elated, and treated <hi>Lycomedes</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Reſpect, eſteeming him the only man amongſt them:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Inſomuch that they choſe ſuch to be Officers as he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, whereby the <hi>Arcadians</hi> became very great: For when the <hi>Argives</hi> entred <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> &amp; their Retreat was cut off by <hi>Chabrias</hi>'s Mercenaries, the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians;</hi> the <hi>Arcadians</hi> opened them a Paſſage, and brought them off, though they ſuffered as well by the difficulty of the Paſſes as the oppoſition of the Enemy. They alſo attempted <hi>Aſina</hi> in <hi>Laconia,</hi> and maſtering the Gariſon, deſtroyed the Suburbs thereof, and killed <hi>Peranor</hi> a <hi>Spartan</hi> Colonel: When ever they had a deſign to march, neither Night nor Storm, nor length of way, nor unpaſſable Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains hindred them; ſo that they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves at this time the hardieſt Souldiers in the World.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons the <hi>Thebans</hi> began to envy, and to be colder in their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards them: But the <hi>Eleans</hi> demanding back of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> thoſe Towns that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took from them, obſerved that they not only ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they ſaid, but magnified the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylians,</hi> and the others that revolted
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:58267:225"/>from them, becauſe they pretended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>Arcadians:</hi> and hereupon the <hi>Eleans</hi> alſo began to be ill affected to them. Thus the Allies entertaining an high opinion of themſelves, <hi>Philiſcus</hi> the <hi>Abydenian</hi> came with a great Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and ſummoned the <hi>Thebans</hi> their Allies, and the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> to <hi>Delphos</hi> about a Peace. When they came there, they did not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Buſineſs to <hi>Apollo,</hi> but debated it amongſt themſelves. At laſt, when the <hi>Thebans</hi> would not yield, that <hi>Meſſene</hi> ſhould remain in the hands of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, Philiſcus</hi> raiſed a great Body of Mercenaries to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in agitation,<note place="margin">Polyzelus Archon.</note> there arrived a ſecond Supply from <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius:</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> declaring it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that they ſhould fall into <hi>Theſſaly</hi> againſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would have had them landed in <hi>Laconia,</hi> and this latter Opinion was approved by the Council of War: Afterwards <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>'s Auxiliaries ſailed round to <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Archidamus</hi> taking the Field with them and his <hi>Spartans,</hi> ſtorm'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryae,</hi> and put the Gariſon to the Sword. From thence he went directly to <hi>Parrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> a Town in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and deſtroyed the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58267:225"/>Country about it. But when the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Argives</hi> came with Succors, he Retreated and Encamped upon the Hills, that overlookt <hi>Midea:</hi> Whilſt he was there, <hi>Ciſſidas</hi> the General of <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Forces declared, that the time limited for his ſtay was expired, and ſo departed home by the way of <hi>Sparta:</hi> But the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> cutting off his Retreat at a narrow Paſs, he ſent to <hi>Archidamus,</hi> and demanded Relief, who accordingly ſuccoured him. When they came to the turning that goes to <hi>Euctreſii,</hi> the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and <hi>Argives</hi> entred <hi>Laconia,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to cut off his Retreat home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but <hi>Archidamus</hi> drawing up in a Level at the meeting of the Roads that lead to <hi>Euctreſii</hi> and <hi>Midea,</hi> came as they ſay, to the head of his Troops, and thus encouraged them.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>When the Fight was over, he erected a Trophy, and diſpatch'd <hi>Demoteles</hi> the Herald home with the News of a great Victory, how that not one of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> fell, but that the Enemy loſt a great many: When News hereof came to <hi>Sparta,</hi> they ſay, that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> firſt wept, and then the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Ephori. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are Tears both to Joy and Grief.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Eleans</hi> growing weary of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> Arrogance were not leſs pleas'd at this their ill Succeſs, than the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>

Whereupon under pretence that <hi>Euthycles</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> was with the King, they exhorted the Confederates to ſend an Embaſſie, and accordingly <hi>Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> went from the <hi>Thebans, Antiochus</hi> the Champion from the <hi>Arcadians, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> from the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and in company of theſe — the <hi>Argive.</hi> On the other hand, the <hi>Athenians</hi> perceiving their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſent <hi>Timagoras</hi> and <hi>Leo:</hi> After they came to <hi>Perſia, Pelopidas</hi> ingratiated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the King more then all of them; for he had to alledge, that of all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> only aſſiſted the <hi>Perſians</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Plataeae,</hi> and that they made War upon the King at no time after; and that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had employed their Arms againſt them, becauſe they would not joyn with <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> againſt the King, nor ſuffer him to Sacrifice to <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Aulis,</hi> where <hi>Agamemnon</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed before his Voyage to <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> when he took <hi>Troy:</hi> It alſo contributed much to the Honour of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> that the <hi>Thebans</hi> had won the Battel at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> and ravaged <hi>Laconia:</hi> He added alſo, that the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Arcadians</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, becauſe the <hi>Thebans</hi> had not aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. <hi>Timagoras</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all that he ſaid, and next to

               <p>After the <hi>Thebans</hi> had ſummoned all the Towns to come and hear the Kings Articles, the <hi>Perſian</hi> that brought them ſhewed the Kings Seal, and read the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. The <hi>Thebans</hi> commanded thoſe that intended to make an Alliance with the King and them, to ratifie it by Oath. The Deputies of the Cities made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they were not ſent to ſwear, but hear, deſiring leave of them, that if any Oath was required, they might firſt conſult their Principals. When <hi>Lycome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> the <hi>Arcadian</hi> alledged, That they ought not to meet at <hi>Thebes,</hi> but where the Seat of the War was: The <hi>Thebans</hi> were concern'd hereat, &amp; gave out that he went about to break the League, becauſe he would not ſit in the Council; but departed, and drew all the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Arcadia</hi> after him: The reſt reſuſing the Oath, the <hi>Thebans</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:58267:228"/>to every City, and exhorted them to ſwear to the Kings Inſtrument, thinking every City would be fearful of incurring both theirs and the Kings diſpleaſure: But they coming firſt to <hi>Corinth,</hi> met with oppoſition there; the <hi>Corinthians</hi> telling them that they had no occaſion to ſwear to a League with the King, and ſeveral other Cities followed their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Thus the Project of the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> about an Univerſal Empire came to nothing.</p>
               <p>But again, when <hi>Epaminondas</hi> deſigned to ſubdue the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and their Allies more pliant; he reſolved to march into <hi>Achaia;</hi> and in order thereunto, perſwaded <hi>Piſias</hi> General of the <hi>Argives,</hi> to go and poſſeſs himſelf of the <hi>Oneum</hi> before-hand. <hi>Piſias</hi> underſtanding that the place was not carefully guarded by <hi>Naucles</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Mercenaries, and <hi>Timomachus</hi> the <hi>Athenian;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeven Days Proviſion, he with two thouſand Heavy-armed men, took an Hill near <hi>Cenchreae</hi> by Night. In the mean while, the <hi>Thebans</hi> and Allies under the Command of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> paſſed the <hi>Oneum,</hi> and entred <hi>Achaia:</hi> The principal men joyned him; and he uſed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58267:228"/>ſo far, that they were neither ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, nor the Government changed; but he took an Engagement from them to be faithful to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and to ſerve them in their Wars. Upon this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home; yet the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and contrary Faction having accuſed him for having ordered the Government after the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Model; the <hi>Thebans</hi> thought fit to ſend Governors to the Cities of <hi>Achaia:</hi> who after their Arrival, with the help of the People diſplaced the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and conſtituted a Democracy. The Baniſhed men being many, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſtrong Party, went ſpeedily to the reſpective Cities, and poſſeſſed themſelves thereof: and after they returned home, they ſtood Neuters no longer, but readily joyned with the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> The <hi>Arcadiaus</hi> what on the one ſide by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and what on the other ſide by the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> were reduced to great ſtraits.</p>
               <p>Till this time <hi>Sicyon</hi> was govern'd by the <hi>Achaean</hi> Laws: Hereupon <hi>Euphron</hi> having the greateſt Intereſt with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> of any of his Country-men, and being deſirous to have the ſame with their Enemies, he acquainted the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Arcadians,</hi> that if the chief men at
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:58267:229"/>
                  <hi>Sicyon</hi> were really poſſeſt of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the City would ſoon ſide with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> again; but if a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy be ſet up, you know for certain, ſaid he, that it will remain at your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. If therefore you will ſtand by me, I will aſſemble the People, and will engage to keep the City firm to your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. This I did before, ſaid he, being offended at the Arrogance of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> as well as you; and deſirous to free my ſelf from ſlavery. This taking with the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Argives,</hi> they went to him, and he preſently aſſembled the People before them in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, <hi>Declaring,</hi> That the Government ſhould be eſtabliſhed upon equal Terms. After the people came together, he bid them chooſe whom they pleaſed for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: They choſe <hi>Euphron, Hippoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Cleander, Acriſius,</hi> and <hi>Lyſander.</hi> Upon this he gave the Command of the Mercenaries to his Son <hi>Adeas,</hi> and diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Liſimenes</hi> who had it before.</p>
               <p>Soon after, <hi>Euphron</hi> by his Favours obliged ſeveral of the Mercenaries to be faithful to him, and hired more, ſparing neither the Publick Treaſure, nor the Conſecrated Money: He baniſhed thoſe who inclin'd to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:58267:229"/>ſeized their Eſtates, murdering ſome of his Colleagues privately, and baniſhing others; whereby he got all into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and became a profeſt Tyrant: And that the Confederates might connive at him, he either brib'd them with money, or readily aſſiſted them with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Troops, when ever they made War; and thus all things went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his mind. The <hi>Argives</hi> fortified <hi>Tricranum</hi> beyond the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Phlius,</hi> and the <hi>Sicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onians Thyamia</hi> in their Frontiers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> were diſtreſſed, and wanted Neceſſaries, yet they ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their League with the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>

                  <hi>Now whereas all Writers take notice of what great Cities do, I think the many and glorious Actions of this ſmall one are as worthy obſervation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were at the greateſt height, the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> were their Allies, and though they were overthrown in the Battel of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> ſeveral of their Country-men revolting, the Slaves fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off, moſt of the Confederates deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in a manner all <hi>Greece</hi> making War upon them, yet the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued faithful: And though they were
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:58267:230"/>engaged in a War with the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Arcadians,</hi> the moſt Potent of the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſians,</hi> nevertheleſs they aſſiſted them; and though it fell to their lot to come the laſt of all the<note n="*" place="margin">Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurians, Traezenians, Hermione<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Halie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Sicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onians, <hi>and</hi> Pellenians.</note> Confederates to <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae,</hi> yet they never forſook the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians:</hi> Nay, when the General of the <hi>Mercenaries</hi> left them, and departed with thoſe who marched on before, they would not turn back again; but (the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Amyclae</hi>) procured a Commander at <hi>Praſiae,</hi> and got as well as they could to <hi>Sparta;</hi> for which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> amongſt other honours they did them, made them a Preſent of an Ox for a welcom.</p>
               <p>After the Enemy retired out of <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the <hi>Argives</hi> being offended at the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> for their good Service to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> fell into the Territory of <hi>Phlius</hi> with all their Forces, and ravaged the Country: yet for all that the <hi>Phlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> would not deſiſt. But when the <hi>Argives</hi> deſtroyed all before them, the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> horſe being but 60, came upon them and following them cloſe, attacked and defeated their Horſe, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that were placed in the Rear to ſecure their Retreat: And though they killed but a few, yet they erected a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:58267:230"/>in view of the <hi>Argives,</hi> and more they could not have done, had they ſlain them all. Again, when the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and their Confederates kept <hi>Oneum,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> came with intent to paſs it; and as the <hi>Eleans</hi> and <hi>Arcadians</hi> were marching through <hi>Nemea</hi> to joyn them, the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Exiles came and brought News, that if they would but appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Phlius,</hi> they might take it: When this was agreed on, the Exiles, and about ſix hundred others came by Night, and lay with their Ladders under the Wall, then the Watchmen diſcoveing the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy from the <hi>Tricra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the Townſmen took the Alarm: In the mean while, thoſe who were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the place, made a ſign to them that lay under the Wall, to mount their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which they did, and ſeized the Arms that the Guards had left, and fell upon the Warders, who were ten in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for one out of every 5 was appointed to ward; one whereof they killed as he lay aſleep, and another as he fled to the Temple of <hi>Juno.</hi> The reſt ſeeing this, leaped confuſedly off the Walls into the City, and the Aſſailants made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the <hi>Citadel</hi> without any oppoſition. Upon the noiſe that was
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:58267:231"/>made, the Citizens came with Relief, and then the Enemy at firſt went out of the <hi>Citadel,</hi> and fought before the Gates that lead to the City; but afterwards being encompaſſed by the Citizens, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired back again to the <hi>Citadel,</hi> and the Heavy-arm'd men falling upon them, immediately cleared the middle of the place. The Enemy remounting the Walls, darted their Javelins, and galled thoſe below, but they on the ground defended themſelves, and fought at the foot of the Ladders. Afterwards the Townſmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſeveral of the <hi>Turrets,</hi> had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot Engagement with the Enemy, who being preſſed hard with the Courage and Valour of the Citizens, were penn'd up in a little room.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Argives</hi> inveſted the City, and threw down the higheſt part of the <hi>Citadel</hi> Wall. Some of the Townſmen who were in the <hi>Tower</hi> darted at the Enemy upon the Wall, others at thoſe who were ſcaling without, and the reſt at thoſe who were poſſeſt of the <hi>Turrets;</hi> and getting Fire out of the Huts carried Wiſps of Hay that was cut in the <hi>Citadel,</hi> and ſet fire to the Enemy in the <hi>Turrets:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome of them leapt down for fear,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:58267:231"/>and thoſe on the Walls were wounded and thrown down by the Townſmen. After the Enemy began to give ground, they immediately quitted the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> and forthwith the horſe marcht out after them; when the Enemy diſcovered them, they retired, and left their Ladders, and their Dead behind them, together with ſome that were maimed, but yet alive. There were ſlain of the Enemy which fought within the <hi>Citadel,</hi> and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted without the Walls, no leſs than eighty. There you might ſee the men Congratulating one another, the Women bringing them drink, &amp; all ſhedding tears together for their great Deliverance; at laſt every one preſent wept for joy.</p>

The Horſe, and the choſen men of the <hi>Phlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> ſupported by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> firſt attacked the Cavalry at the paſs of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and defeated them, compelling them to retire the reſt of the day into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:58267:232"/>as it were, taking care that they might not trample down their Friends Corn in the Valleys. Again the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Sicyon</hi> made another Attempt upon <hi>Phlius,</hi> drawing out the <hi>Thebans</hi> he had in Gariſon, together with the <hi>Sicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onians</hi> and <hi>Pellenians,</hi> for they then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the <hi>Thebans,</hi> whom <hi>Euphron</hi> joyned with two thouſand of his <hi>Mercenaries:</hi> The reſt marched down by the <hi>Tricra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> to <hi>Juno</hi>'s Temple, making as if they would deſtroy all the Country before them. The <hi>Sicyonians</hi> and <hi>Pellenians</hi> were poſted by the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gate on the top of an Hill, that the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> might not ſurround them, and gain an Eminence which lay beyond <hi>Juno</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> perceived that the Enemy would fall into the Plain, the Horſe and choſen men made oppoſition and hindred them from entring it; ſo that moſt part of the Day was ſpent in Skirmiſhing, <hi>Euphron</hi>'s men purſuing the Enemy as far as the Horſe could paſs, and the Townſmen as far as <hi>Juno</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the Enemy thought it was time to march off, they went round to the <hi>Tricranum,</hi> becauſe the Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wall hindred them from paſſing the direct way to the <hi>Pellenians,</hi> but the

                  <hi>Phliaſians</hi> purſuing them a little way as far as to the riſing Ground, they faced about, and marched on by the Wall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Pellenians,</hi> and their Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates. The <hi>Theban</hi> Governour being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> diligence, did his utmoſt endeavour to give the <hi>Pelleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> timely aſſiſtance, but the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Horſe prevented him, and fell upon the <hi>Pellenians,</hi> who at firſt received them, and made them retreat; but the latter joyning the Foot that were come up, charged them again, and cloſed. Soon after the Enemy gave ground, and ſome of the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> fell together with a great many brave men of the <hi>Pellenians.</hi> For this Action the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> erected a noble Trophy, and according to the cuſtom ſang an Hymn.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>Theban</hi> General and <hi>Euphron</hi> beheld this Skirmiſh from ſeveral places, as if they had intended to have ſeen a ſight. Afterwards the Enemy returned home to <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the City. The <hi>Phliaſians</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves incomparably well in this Action, and tho they were reduced to great want, yet they diſcharged a <hi>Pelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who had been their publick Hoſt, without ranſom. <hi>Who would not allow

               <p>Much about this time, <hi>Aeneas</hi> the <hi>Stymphalian,</hi> General of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> thinking the Tranſactions at <hi>Sicyon</hi> were not to be endured, went up into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel with his Army, and aſſembled the principal Men of the <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> recalling thoſe who were baniſhed without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Decree. <hi>Euphron</hi> fearing this, fled to the Port of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Paſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melus</hi> from <hi>Corinth,</hi> by which means he delivered up the Port to the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and again embraced their Alliance, profeſſing he had ever been faithful to them: for when it was put to a vote whether they ſhould break with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> or no, he with a few more declar'd againſt it.

               <p>The principal Men and People of <hi>Sicyon</hi> being divided, <hi>Euphron</hi> return'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Country, bringing with him ſome Mercenaries from <hi>Athens,</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance he poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Town, but the <hi>Theban</hi> Governor had the Cittadel. <hi>Euphron</hi> knowing it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to maintain the City, whilſt the <hi>Theban</hi> held the Cittadel, raiſed money, and going to <hi>Thebes,</hi> perſwaded the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> to baniſh the principal Men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Town again.

But theſe have ſo far tranſcended all Men in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and villany, that without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they have murdered a man in the face of you the Magiſtrates, who have the power of Life and Death; if theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer not the utmoſt ſeverity of the Law, who will dare to come hereafter to this City? And what will become of this place, if every man may kill thoſe that come hither, before they declare what buſineſs they come about. We proſecute theſe as the most impious and lawleſs Fellows, who have in an high nature acted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Government. Now ye have heard the Caſe, inflict on them what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment you think they deſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſaid the Magiſtrates, the Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians denied all that they were concerned in the Murder, except one, who confeſs'd it, and began to make his Defence in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords of</hi> Thebes,<note place="margin">The Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> 
                  <hi>That man dares not offer any contempt to you, who knows that ye have power to uſe him as ye pleaſe. I'll now declare upon what Grounds I kill'd this man. Ye may aſſure your ſelves, the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:58267:236"/>firſt reaſon was, becauſe I thought it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; another is that I might bring you to a right underſtanding of the caſe. I found when</hi> Archias <hi>and</hi> Hypates <hi>perpetrated the ſame villanies that</hi> Euphron <hi>did, ye never ſtaid for the formality of a Trial, but did juſtice on them the first opportunity: for you grant, that they who are ſacrilegious perſons, notorious Traitors and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers have already received the ſentence of death from all mankind. And certainly</hi> Euphron <hi>was guilty of all theſe Crimes; for he left the Temples naked, which he found adorn'd with Offerings of Gold and Silver. Who was a more profeſs'd Traitor than</hi> Euphron? <hi>For being a great Friend to the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>he preferr'd your intereſt before theirs; and then having engaged himſelf to you, forſook your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt again, and delivered up the Port to your Enemies. And was not he a notorious Tyrant, in that he both freed the Slaves, and naturalized them, killing, baniſhing and confiſcating the Estates, not only of the innocent, but whomſoever he liſted, and amongſt theſe Men of the chiefeſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Beſide being recalled from exile, by the favour of the</hi> Athenians <hi>your invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemies, he took Arms againſt your Governor, and ſince he was not able to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:58267:236"/>drive him out of the Cittadel, he has ſcrap'd up money, and is come hither. If he had appear'd openly in Arms againſt you, ye would have return'd me thanks for killing him; now when he has brought mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to corrupt you, and ſo to procure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be made ſupreme of his Country, how can I in Juſtice be put to death, for inflicting on him his deſerved puniſhment? They that are oppreſſed by violence ſuffer indeed, yet cannot be thought unjuſt; but thoſe who are baſely corrupted with Bribes, both ſuffer and fall into diſgrace too. If therefore he were my Enemy, and your Friend, I confeſs I have then done ill in killing him amongst you: But how came he that betray'd you to be more my Enemy than yours? Perhaps ſome will ſay he came hither of his own accord; therefore if any had killed him without your City he had been commended. But now he is come to add more miſchief to his former, you can't deny but that he was juſtly put to death. How can he, that maintains,</hi> He was unjuſtly killed, <hi>make it appear, that Traitors, Renegades, or Tyrants are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the publick Leagues amongst the Greeks. Moreover, I deſire you would call to mind a Decree made by you, wherein you give leave to ſeize
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:58267:237"/>Exiles, and take them out of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Cities: Now can any one ſay, that that Exile is unjuſtly killed, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home without the general Decree of the Allies? My Lords, I affirm, that if you put me to death, you revenge the blood of him who was your moſt inveterate Enemy. But if you find I have done according to Law, you will not only do justice to your ſelves, but all your Allies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> hearing this, decreed, that <hi>Euphron</hi> had ſuffered condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But his Fellow-Citizens having an high opinion of him, carried him to <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and buried him in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, adoring him as their Founder. <hi>For all people would have their Benefactors eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good men.</hi> Hitherto I have ſpoken of <hi>Euphron,</hi> and now return from my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>Phliaſians</hi> were fortifying <hi>Thyamia,</hi> and <hi>Chares</hi> was there, the Exiles ſurpriſed <hi>Oropus,</hi> to which place when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had drawn their whole Forces, and ſent for <hi>Chares,</hi> they being aſſiſted by the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> retook the Port of <hi>Sicyon.</hi> None of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates aided the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but marched away, and depoſited <hi>Oropus</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> till the Controverſie was
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:58267:237"/>decided. But when <hi>Lycomedes</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>Athenians</hi> complained of the Confederates, that theſe created them a great deal of trouble, and yet no body aſſiſted them; he perſwaded the ten thouſand to treat with the <hi>Athenians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Alliance. At firſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> being in League with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſome of them thought it hard to confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with their Enemies, yet conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it would be as advantageous <hi>to the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>as themſelves,</hi> for the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to be deprived of the <hi>Thebans</hi> aſſiſtance, they at laſt accepted the League. <hi>Lycomedes</hi> having diſpatch'd this Affair, parted from <hi>Athens,</hi> and died after a ſtrange manner: for there being ſeveral Ships, he choſe one which he liked beſt, and agreeing to be ſet on ſhore where he pleaſed, he fell by chance into the hands of the Exiles, and ſo was killed.</p>
               <p>The League was thus concluded, but <hi>Demotion</hi> making a Speech to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Athens,</hi> declared, That in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it was judiciouſly made, yet that they ought to order the Generals to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Corinth.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> hearing this, immediately ſent ſufficient Guards of their own to every place where the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:58267:238"/>
                  <hi>Athenians</hi> were in Garriſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to depart, becauſe they had no occaſion for them. Accordingly they complied. Afterwards when the <hi>Athenians</hi> flocked out of the Forts into the City, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That if any of them had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any injury, the Law was open, and they ſhould have Juſtice done them. Whilſt Affairs ſtood thus, <hi>Chares</hi> arrived with his Fleet at <hi>Cenchreae,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what had paſſed, told them, that hearing of a Deſign againſt the City, he was come to aſſiſt them, they gave him their thanks, yet did not receive his Fleet into their Harbour, but ordered him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. In like manner, having paid off the heavy-arm'd Men, they diſmiſs'd them. Thus <hi>Corinth</hi> was clear'd of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were obliged by the Treaty to aſſiſt the <hi>Arcadians</hi> with a Body of Horſe, in caſe their Country was invaded: but not to enter <hi>Laconia</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> conſidering it would be difficult to ſecure themſelves, being they were already preſſed at Land, and had the <hi>Athenians</hi> for a new Enemy, who alone were too great a Match, reſolved to raiſe Mercenary Horſe and Foot, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:58267:238"/>them themſelves, whereby they might not only ſecure their own City, but act offenſively againſt their Enemies. Beſides they ſent to <hi>Thebes</hi> to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might have a peace; the <hi>Thebans</hi> gave them encouragement, yet they choſe firſt to conſult their Allies about it, being willing to make peace with thoſe that deſired it, and to let thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred War, to have a War. The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> giving their conſent, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> went to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and there delivered themſelves after this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords of</hi> Lacedemon,<note place="margin">The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> Speech to the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We your Allies are come hither, requiring you, that if you have any proſpect of ſucceſs by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the War, to inform us thereof: but if your Affairs be reduced to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it will be for your Intereſt as well as ours to make a Peace. There is no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World that we had rather be ſecure with, than with yours. But if you think War can be advantageous to you, we deſire you to give us the liberty of making peace for our ſelves. If we be preſerv'd we may at a ſeaſonable time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you; but if we be now ruined, we can never be ſerviceable to you hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hearing this, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to make peace, and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:58267:239"/>permitted the other Allies that were not diſpoſed to carry on the War, to ſit ſtill, declaring, as for themſelves, they would hold out, and ſubmit to Providence. But to part with <hi>Meſſene,</hi> which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Anceſtors, they would yield to never. Thereupon the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> went to <hi>Thebes</hi> for Peace. The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> required them to make a League offenſive and defenſive: to which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made anſwer, That ſuch a League was not a Peace, but an Exchange of the War; however, if they thought good, they were willing to make one upon equal Terms. The <hi>Thebans</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, becauſe they would not be ungrateful to their Benefactors, tho they were expoſed to danger, granted them, the <hi>Phliaſians,</hi> and the reſt that came with them a Peace upon condition, that every one ſhould poſſeſs their own, and on theſe terms it was ratified. The <hi>Phliaſians</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon concluſion of the Treaty quitted <hi>Thyamia;</hi> but the <hi>Argives,</hi> tho they had ſworn to the Peace, being not able to procure the ſame Freedom for the <hi>Phliaſian</hi> Exiles in <hi>Tricranum,</hi> as in their own City, poſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>Thyamia,</hi> and placed a Garriſon there, alledging the Territory belong'd to them,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:58267:239"/>tho a little before they had deſtroyed it in an hoſtile manner, and when the <hi>Phlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> demanded Juſtice, they denyed it them.</p>
               <p>Much about this time,<note place="margin">Chion Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon.</note> 
                  <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder died, and his Son ſent twelve Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, commanded by <hi>Timocrates,</hi> to aid the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> who, after he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, aſſiſted them in the taking of <hi>Sella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and then returned home again. Not long after, the <hi>Eleans</hi> took <hi>Laſio,</hi> which formerly belonged to them, but at that time it was under the juriſdiction of the <hi>Arcadians.</hi> The <hi>Arcadians</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not, but immediately aſſembled their Forces together, and took the Field, againſt whom the <hi>Eleans</hi> came out firſt with four hundred Men, and then with three hundred more encamping all the day in a Plain. In the night the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> march'd up to the top of an Hill that over-looked the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and came down upon them by break of day. The <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſeeing, that they were ſtronger, and march'd from the higher Ground, were yet aſhamed for ſome time to decamp; but the <hi>Arcadians</hi> attacking them at laſt, they ſcarce came to handy-blows before they fled, and loſt a great many Men and Arms in their Retreat, through the ſtrait Paſſes.</p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:58267:240"/>
               <p>After this Action, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Towns of the <hi>Acrorians,</hi> and having taken all but <hi>Thrauſtus,</hi> paſſed on to <hi>Olympia;</hi> where making a Trench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Temple, they put in a Garriſon there, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of Mount <hi>Olympus.</hi> Then they took <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> upon ſurrender. The <hi>Eleans</hi> were wholly dejected at this ſucceſs of their Enemies. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> alſo came up to the very City, and advanced as far as the Market-place, where the <hi>Elean</hi> Horſe, and ſome others beſide encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring them beat them them out, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving killed ſome of them erected a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Sometime before this, there were Diviſions at <hi>Elis,</hi> for the Faction of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropus, Thraſonidas</hi> and <hi>Argeus</hi> brought in a Democracy, and that of <hi>Stalcas, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> and <hi>Stratolas</hi> an Oligarchy. But the <hi>Arcadians</hi> having a great power, and inclining to thoſe who were for a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, <hi>Charopus</hi>'s Party thereby became bolder, agreeing with the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to aſſiſt them, and ſurpriſe the Cittadel. The Horſe and the three hundred Foot obſerving them, march'd up thither, and beat them out, ſo that <hi>Argeus</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropus</hi> with about four hundred more were baniſhed. Not long after being
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:58267:240"/>ſupported by a Body of <hi>Arcadians,</hi> they took <hi>Pylus,</hi> to which place there had been a Concourſe of People from the City, as being wealthy, and having ſo powerful aſſiſtance from the <hi>Arcadians;</hi> who afterwards entered the <hi>Eleans</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being perſwaded by the Exiles, that the City would yield to them. But the <hi>Achaeans</hi> being at that time in League with the <hi>Eleans,</hi> protected them, ſo that the <hi>Arcadiaus</hi> only harraſſed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and retired.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were march'd out of the Territory of <hi>Elis,</hi> being inform'd, that ſome <hi>Pellenians</hi> were in the City, they took a long March in the Night, and poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Olurus,</hi> a Town that belonged to the <hi>Pellenians,</hi> becauſe they were in League with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</hi> After the <hi>Pellenians</hi> heard the News of <hi>Olurus,</hi> they fetched a long compaſs, and returned to their own City. Afterwards, tho they were but a ſmall Party, yet they attacked the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and all the people in <hi>Olurus;</hi> nor did they deſiſt till they had taken it. Again the <hi>Arcadians</hi> attempted <hi>Elis</hi> in another Voyage; and whilſt they encamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cyllene</hi> and the City, the <hi>Eleans</hi> attacked them; but the <hi>Arcadians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:58267:241"/>their firſt Charge, repulſed them. Whereupon <hi>Andromachus</hi> the Governor of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> who perſwaded them to fight, kill'd himſelf, the reſt retired into the Town, and <hi>Soclidas</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Fight was ſlain, for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> were at this time in League with the <hi>Eleans.</hi> When the <hi>Eleans</hi> were hard preſſed at home, they ſent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and deſired the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to fall upon the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> thinking the beſt way to divert them would be to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them on both ſides. Thereupon <hi>Archidamus</hi> marched out with the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> and taking <hi>Cromnus,</hi> left there a Garriſon of three Companies out of twelve, and ſo returned home.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arcadians</hi> being aſſembled about the Expedition againſt <hi>Elis,</hi> marched with their Forces, and ſecuring themſelves with a double Trench, beſieged <hi>Cromnus.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that their People ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, ſent out another Army under the Leading of <hi>Archidamus,</hi> who went and deſtroyed all <hi>Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Sciris,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, if it were poſſible, to raiſe the Siege; yet the <hi>Arcadians</hi> ſtirred not from the place, nor took any notice of them.</p>

When all, as well the <hi>Tegeans,</hi> as the <hi>Theban</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded three hundred <hi>Boeotian</hi> heavy-arm'd Men at <hi>Tegea,</hi> had taken the Oaths, ſome of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at <hi>Tegea</hi> feaſted, and were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, offering Sacrifices, and ſinging Hymns, as tho the Peace had been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Ratified.

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:58267:245"/>Gates of <hi>Tegea</hi> to be ſhut, ſent Officers to thoſe that were making merry, and ſeized the Principal Perſons amongſt them. For every one being deſirous of Peace, there was a great Concourſe of People from all the Cities of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> whereby there muſt needs be a great many taken, inſomuch that the Priſon and Town-Houſe were filled with them. Several were committed to Cuſtody, ſome leap'd down the Walls, and others were let out at the Gates; (for no body was incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any one, except thoſe that thought they ſhould be put to death) which put the <hi>Theban</hi> Commander, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices to their Wits-ends, becauſe they had ſeized very few of the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> whom chiefly they deſign'd to take, for their City being near moſt of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped home. When it was day, and the <hi>Mantineans</hi> heard how Affairs went, they ſent immediately to all the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Towns, ſummoning them to appear in Arms, and to be upon their Guard, as they were. At the ſame time they ſent to <hi>Tegea,</hi> and demanded the <hi>Mantine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> they had <hi>ſeiz'd;</hi> Adding, that no <hi>Arcadian</hi> ought to be impriſoned or put to death without a tryal. And ſome there were who blam'd them for theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,

The <hi>Theban</hi> Commander hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, could not tell how to govern himſelf, but diſcharged all the Priſoners; and the Day following, calling together as many <hi>Arcadians</hi> as would aſſemble, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf before them, ſaying, he was miſtaken; and told them, that he heard that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers with their Army, and that ſome of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were ready to betray <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gea</hi> to them: which when they heard, they let him go, though they knew that he impoſed upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arcadians</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Thebes</hi> to Impeach this Commander of Treaſon; and then they report, that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> who was at that time their General, ſhould ſay; That he did much better in ſeizing the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> than in diſcharging them: For, ſaid he, Why may not he accuſe you of Treaſon, when we for your ſakes made War, and you without our Conſent have concluded a Peace? Aſſure your ſelves, ſaid he, we will employ our Arms againſt <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and make a joynt War with our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates. When this was reported to the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:58267:246"/>Community of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and the Account hereof ſpread through every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the reſt of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Mantine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Eleans, Achaeans.</note> thoſe that were concern'd for <hi>Peloponefus</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from hence, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> did endeavour to weaken the <hi>Peloponeſians</hi> what they could, that ſo they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them with the more eaſe: For, ſaid they, Why would they have us both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in a War, unleſs it was to weaken one another, that ſo both of us may ſtand in need of their aſſiſtance? Why do they make Preparations for a Campagn, tho' we have told them that we have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at this time for them? Is it not manifeſt that they deſign us miſchief? Thereupon they ſent to <hi>Athens</hi> for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and diſpatch'd the <hi>Epariti</hi> on an Embaſſie to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to joyn Forces, and preſerve <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> from ſlavery. Then they determined the matter about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Chief, how that each Republick ſhould command in their own Territories.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in agitation,<note place="margin">Chariclides Archon.</note> 
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> took the Field with all the <hi>Boeotians, Eubaeans,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> he had from <hi>Alexander,</hi> and from his Enemies: The <hi>Phoceans</hi> did not joyn them, alledging they had agreed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:58267:246"/>the <hi>Thebans</hi> if any invaded them; but it was not in the Articles to make a War Offenſive. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> conſidered that they had the <hi>Argives, Meſſenians,</hi> and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> which ſided with them: the <hi>Tegeans</hi> alſo, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galapolitans, Aſeans, Palanteans,</hi> and ſome other ſmall Towns that lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe which were compelled to follow them: He marched out with great diligence, and arriving at <hi>Nemea,</hi> made an halt there, hoping to intercept the <hi>Athenians</hi> that were paſſing that way; thinking this would be of great moment to confirm the Confederates, and to put the Enemy into a Conſternation; and in ſhort, every thing would be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him that incommoded the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> Whilſt he remained there, all the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> that had confederated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, aſſembled at <hi>Mantinea:</hi> But as ſoon as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> underſtood that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had changed their reſolution of marching by Land, and made Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by Sea, to paſs with their Army through <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to the relief of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> he decamped from <hi>Nemea,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Tegea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot ſay that this Expedition of his was much ſucceſsful, though I find
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:58267:247"/>nothing of Conduct or Courage want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him: Firſt I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for encamping within the Walls of <hi>Tegea,</hi> as having there a ſecurer Poſt; than if he had been without, and being more private from the Enemies underſtanding his Deſigns: Beſides, if he had occaſion for any neceſſaries, they might be eaſier procured in the City: and the Enemy encamping without the Town might be diſcovered if they did any thing well, or committed any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: And becauſe he thought himſelf ſtronger than the Enemy, as often as he ſaw them attempt the taking any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Poſts, he went not out to attack them. But wen he found never a Town would ſurrender to him, and that the Seaſon advanced, he thought he muſt perform ſome remarkable Exploit, or elſe expect ſome great Diſgrace inſtead of his former Glory.</p>
               <p>Therefore being Advertiſed that the Enemy was ſtrongly encamped near <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and had ſent for <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and all the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> being informed alſo that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was already marcht as far as <hi>Pellene;</hi> he Supped, and giving Orders to the Army, moved directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sparta:</hi> And if a certain <hi>Cretan</hi>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:58267:247"/>by a ſpecial Providence had not informed <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> that the Army was upon their march, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had ſurprized the City like a Neſt of young Ones, wholly defenceleſs: But <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> having firſt Intelligence of it, reached the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enemy, and poſted his <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> who though but an handfull, defended the Place. For all their Horſe, their Mercenary Troops, and three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies out of Ten were march'd on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into <hi>Arcadia.</hi> After <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was come to <hi>Sparta,</hi> he did not enter the Town where the Enemy might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him in the Plain, or where they might have thrown their Darts from off the Houſes, or where a ſmall number could have done as much ſervice as a greater; but took a Place of which he thought he could make advantage, and ſo went down, not up into the City. <hi>But what hapned there afterwards may be partly aſcribed to Providence; or elſe it may be ſaid, that no Power can reſiſt the Deſperate.</hi> For though <hi>Archidamus</hi> had not an hundred men, he not only paſſed over the River, where in probability he might have been hindred, but marched up a riſing Ground to the Enemy; and there thoſe Souldiers that breathed Fire,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:58267:248"/>that had beaten the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that were in every reſpect ſtronger than they, and on higher Ground, could not ſuſtain the Charge of <hi>Archidamus</hi>'s Men, but gave ground, and the foremoſt of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>'s Men were ſlain. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> being tranſported with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and purſuing the Enemy too far, came off with ſome loſs: <hi>For as it ſeems, Providence had circumſcribed the bounds of the Victory how far it ſhould extend. Archidamus</hi> erected a Trophy in the Place where he had routed the Enemy, and deliver'd their Dead upon Truce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> conſidering that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi> were coming to the relief of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi> would not fight them and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> together; eſpecially theſe having been lately ſucceſsful, and his own Men foiled. Wherefore marching back again with all ſpeed to <hi>Tegea,</hi> and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heavy-arm'd men, he ſent his Horſe to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> deſiring them to hold out bravely; telling them that probably all the <hi>Mantineans</hi> and their Cattel were without the Walls, it being the time that they houſed their Corn; accordingly they went: In the mean while the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Horſe marching from <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Cleone,</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:58267:248"/>arrived at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and took up their Quarters in the City. The <hi>mantineans</hi> being certified that the Enemies <hi>Cavalry</hi> were coming thither, deſired the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Horſe to aſſiſt them if 'twere poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for all their Cattel were abroad, as alſo their Workmen; a great many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and old Men that were free. The <hi>Athenians</hi> hearing this, went out to their Aſſiſtance, before either they or their Horſes had eaten.</p>
               <p>Here who can enough admire the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of theſe Horſes, who though they ſaw the Enemy were far ſtronger, and tho they themſelves had had a Diſaſter at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> they yet never call'd it to mind, or that they were to fight with the <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſe, which were counted the beſt in the World: But aſhamed to come thither without doing the Confederates any Service; as ſoon as ever they came in view of the Enemy, deſirous to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Glory of their Anceſtors, they engaged them, and by this Encounter ſaved all that the <hi>Mantineans</hi> had abroad; yet they loſt ſome brave men, and ſlew alſo ſome ſuch of the Enemy: For there was none on either ſide that had ſo ſhort a Weapon, but that he could reach his Enemy therewith: At laſt they carried
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:58267:249"/>off their Friends that were ſlain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Enemy theirs upon Truce.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Epaminondas</hi> conſidering, that within a few days he ſhould be obliged to depart, becauſe the time ſet for the Expedition was elapſed; and that if he ſhould leave them expoſed, whom he came to aſſiſt, then they would be beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Enemy, and himſelf ſhould loſe all his former Glory: (becauſe he, and a ſtrong body of Heavy-arm'd men had been beaten at <hi>Lacedemon</hi> by a few, foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Mantinea</hi> in a Skirmiſh with the Horſe; and that his Voyage into <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus</hi> had given occaſion to the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, Arcadians, Achaeans, Eleans,</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> to enter into a Confederacy) thought it was not poſſible for him to retreat without fighting; conſidering too, that if he conquer'd he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all theſe Difficulties, and that if he were killed, it would be thought a Noble Death, by having attempted to leave his Country, the Soveraignty of <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> Nor is it any great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to me that he ſhould entertain theſe Deſigns, for theſe are the thoughts of men that are Lovers of Glory: But this is a greater wonder, that he ſo inur'd his Souldiers to refuſe no kind of Toyl
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:58267:249"/>either by Day or Night, to decline no Danger, and to obey his Commands though they wanted Proviſions. For at laſt, when he gave out orders to his Army to prepare themſelves for Battel, the Horſe readily at his Command white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Head-pieces, and ſome of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Heavy-arm'd men form'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Companies, and carried Clubs after the manner of the <hi>Thebans:</hi> Laſtly, all whetted their Spears and Swords, and ſcoured their Bucklers. It is worth while to obſerve what he did after he had got them in this good Order.</p>
               <p>At firſt, as is uſual, he drew up in <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Battel at <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi>
                  </note> and then ſignified that Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be made for a Battel: after he had drawn up as he beſt liked, he did not take the ſhorteſt Cut to the Enemy, but led to the Hills that lay on the Weſt of <hi>Tegea,</hi> and oppoſite to the place where he was: So that he made the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would not fight that Day. But after he came to the Mountains, and had extended his Army in Front, he made a halt under the Hills, as though he was about to Encamp; and by this abated the prepared Fury of the Enemy to fight, and made them negligent of the order of Battel they had drawn up
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:58267:250"/>in: But bringing the Companies that were placed in File to the Front,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> and making a ſtrong Wedge about himſelf, he commanded them to take up their Arms again and led them on. When the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſaw them advance contrary to their expectation, no one ſtood ſtill, but ſome ran to their Ranks, others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelves in <hi>Battalia;</hi> ſome bridled their Horſes, and put on their Armour, and ſeemed rather to be made a Carnage of, than to make one. On the other hand, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> led on his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, being like the oppoſite Stem of a Galley, concluding that where-ever he made an Impreſſion, there he ſhould ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine their whole Body: For he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to charge with the Flower of his Forces, leaving the Weaker part a good way off; conſidering that if this were beaten, it would put the reſt into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and add Reſolution to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p>The Enemy had drawn up their Horſe in depth like a <hi>Battalion</hi> of Heavy-arm'd men, not having flank'd them with Foot. on the contrary, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> made a firm Wedge of his Horſe, and placed Foot by them, thinking that after he had broke through the Enemies Horſe, he
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:58267:250"/>ſhould beat all the reſt of their Army: For 'tis very hard to find any that will abide by't, when they ſee their Fellow-Souldiers run. Now that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> on the left might not relieve thoſe next them, he poſted ſome Horſe and Heavy-arm'd men on the oppoſite Hills, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in fear, that if they went to the relief of their men, theſe would fall on their Rear: Nor did he ſail of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for fighting in this order, he beat that Part he charged, and put the whole Army to flight: But after he fell himſelf, the others knew not how to uſe the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for when the <hi>Battalion</hi> that charged them fled, the Heavy-arm'd men killed no body, nor advanced from the place where the Fight began. In like manner when the Enemies Horſe ſled, the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> did not purſue them, nor their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-arm'd men, but as if they had been beaten, got diſorderly away through the flying Enemy: The Foot and the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getiers by agreement moved together with the Horſe to the left, as if they had been Victorious, where moſt of them were cut in pieces by the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Action hapned contrary to the expectation of all men; for moſt part of <hi>Greece</hi> being got together, and drawn
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:58267:251"/>up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> every one believed that if there were a Fight, the Victors would rule, and the Vanquiſht obey: But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo ordered it, that both ſides as Victors ſet up Trophies, and neither ſide hindred the other from erecting them: both as Conquerors delivered the Slain upon Truce, and both as Conquered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them upon Truce. And though both pretended to the Victory, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other enlarg'd their Territories, or encreaſed their Power; but after the Fight there aroſe greater Confuſion and Troubles in <hi>Greece,</hi> than ever were at any time before.</p>

Our Author continues the Hiſtory of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, which <hi>Thucydides</hi> began, and brought down as far as the end of Summer, in the Twenty firſt Year of the War, to the Second Battel at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> containing the Space of Forty eight Years. <hi>Didorus Siculus</hi> affirms in his XIII. Book, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> was the Continuator of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides;</hi> but miſtakes in aſſerting that <hi>Thucydides</hi> wrote to the Twenty ſecond Year of the War; becauſe the latter in the cloſe of his VIII. Book, ſays, That the Twenty firſt Year would not be Compleated, till the Winter that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Summer, where he breaks off his Hiſtory, was elapſed.</p>
            <p>Some learned men allow <hi>Xenophon</hi> to be the Continuator of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> but yet they would have the Hiſtory of
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:58267:252"/>ſome Years wanting; concluding it both from the abrupt beginning, which has no Introduction as the reſt of his Works, and from the Account by <hi>Olympiades</hi> and <hi>Archons.</hi> 'Tis very probable the firſt may be ſo far true, that ſomething may be defective, though not whole Years; but the Argument they fetch from the <hi>Olympiades</hi> and <hi>Archons</hi> to prove it, is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, becauſe that Account was not ſo early in uſe as theſe Authors, as has been formerly obſerv'd by a learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and therefore I have ſet them in the <hi>Margin</hi> as being a Gloſs, and inſerted into the <hi>Text.</hi> Moreover the conſtant Notation of Time throughout <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> is by Summer and Winter, and 'tis by accident that either of them make any mention of <hi>Olympick</hi> Years, and when they do, 'tis not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Annals of the History,</hi> but to ſome dependance the Hiſtory has on them.</p>
            <p>But further to prove that <hi>Xenophon</hi> was the Continuator of <hi>Thucydides:</hi> I ſhall alledge a Law of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that barred the ſame perſon from being twice Admiral, which is mentioned both in the ſecond Book of this <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> on
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:58267:252"/>this occaſion. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being vanquiſht by the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the Sea Fight at <hi>Arginuſae,</hi> their Affairs were reduced to a very ill Condition: yet the Confederates reſolving to repair their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Loſſes, Requeſted the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to ſend them <hi>Lyſander</hi> to Command their Fleet; having the experience of his Conduct in the Fight at <hi>Notium;</hi> wherein he overthrew the <hi>Athenians;</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> anſwered them, that by their Law none might be twice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral; thereupon they gave <hi>Aracus</hi> the Command of the Fleet, chooſing <hi>Lyſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to go in Quality of his Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Moreover the Admirals continued but a year in their Office: For we find in the firſt Book of this Hiſtory, that as ſoon as <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s year was elaps'd, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent <hi>Callicratidas</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him.</p>
            <p>Furthermore <hi>Thucydides</hi> in his laſt Book witneſſes, that <hi>Mindarus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Astyochus</hi> in the Command of the Fleet, and <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the firſt Book of his Hiſtory, implies that he was Admiral; becauſe he mentions <hi>Hegeſandridas</hi> as his Vice-Admiral.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſince none could be twice Admiral by the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Law, and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:58267:253"/>none could bear that Office longer than a year: And being <hi>Thucydides</hi> in the end of the eighth Book, and <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Hiſtory, affirm, that <hi>Minda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was Admiral; it follows that the one ends, and the other begins in the ſame year.</p>
            <p>In the next place it is to be conſidered, that there are two Opinions concerning the duration of the War. <hi>Thucydides</hi> in his Fifth Book, ſays, That it laſted Twenty ſeven years, and ended when the Walls of the <hi>Pireus</hi> were demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſays, Twenty eight and an half, acounting till the time that <hi>Lyſander</hi> return'd home in Triumph: Yet there was but half a year betwixt the Demoliſhing of the Walls, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>'s Triumph; ſo that there is the difference of a year between both Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that as there are two ends of this War, ſo there are as many beginnings: For <hi>Thucydides</hi> accounts from the time of Action, and <hi>Xenophon</hi> from the Declaration of the War, which was when the Ambaſſadors of the Allies aſſembled at <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> to Confederate againſt the <hi>Athenians:</hi> and the like Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <hi>Thucydides</hi> makes in his Second Book; where he ſays, That <hi>Pericles</hi> died
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:58267:253"/>two years and an half after the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; which muſt be underſtood in <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>'s ſenſe and not in his own.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved that <hi>Xenophon</hi> is the Continuator of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and that there is no defect of any year; I proceed to ſet out the Six years and an half of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, that this Author writes of: the end of the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firſt year, and beginning of the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond are not diſtinguiſhed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I have followed <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> herein, and placed the Death of <hi>Minda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in the end of the Twenty firſt year, and began the Twenty ſecond with the Baniſhment of the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Captains; the other five years are expreſly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the <hi>Chronology</hi> is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, which amongſt other things makes me think that <hi>Xenophon</hi> did not finiſh this Piece, becauſe the Notation of Time is frequently omitted, and in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Sequel of an Action not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but interrupted with ſome new rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have in order to the clearing of it, made four <hi>Periods;</hi> the firſt to the Fight at <hi>Cnidus,</hi> the ſecond to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talcidean</hi> Peace, the third to the Battel at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> and the fourth to that at
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:58267:254"/>
               <hi>Mantinea.</hi> And becauſe the Marks of Time are wanting in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> I have fitted them to the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and where the years are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, I have ſupplied them out of the latter.</p>
            <p>There is but one Notation of Time in the latter part of the Hiſtory, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the Fifth Book, concerning the <hi>Mantinean</hi> War, that broke out at the Expiration of the Thirty years Truce made after the firſt Battel at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> which was fought in the Fourteenth year of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, and the third of the Ninety third <hi>Olympiad;</hi> ſo that accounting from that time to the third of the Ninety eighth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> when this War began, there are Two and thirty Years; and reck'ning excluſively, that is, neither the year when the Truce was made, nor the Year when the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and there will remain Thirty, the Number ſought.</p>
